In Lean4, we represent:\n- Points as elements of EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 2) (2D Euclidean plane)\n- Equilateral condition via distance equality: dist A B = dist A C ∧ dist A C = dist B C\n- Points on sides using segment membership: L ∈ segment ℝ B C captures \"L is on BC\"\n\n**Step 2: Distance Formalization**\nThe original uses geometric notation (MA, AN, etc.) which naturally maps to Lean's dist function:\n- MA becomes dist M A\n- AN becomes dist A N  \n- BC² becomes dist B C ^ 2\n\n**Step 3: Inequality Structure**\nThe strict inequality MA·AN + NB·BL + LC·CM < BC² directly translates to:\ndist M A * dist A N + dist N B * dist B L + dist L C * dist C M < dist B C ^ 2\n\n**Key Insight:** The problem exploits the special properties of equilateral triangles and the constraint that points lie on sides (not just anywhere on lines).

Overall Comparison\n\nThe Lean4 theorem captures the core geometric setup and inequality statement of the original problem. It correctly formalizes the equilateral triangle, the points on the sides, and the main inequality involving products of distances. However, there is a critical issue with how the equilateral triangle condition is formalized that affects the mathematical accuracy of the translation.\n\n## 2. Condition-by-Condition Correspondence\n\n* **Condition 1**: $\\triangle ABC$ is an equilateral triangle → `(hABC : dist A B = dist A C ∧ dist A C = dist B C)` → **✗ Incorrect**\n  The Lean4 condition only requires two equalities: $|AB| = |AC|$ and $|AC| = |BC|$, which implies $|AB| = |BC|$ by transitivity. However, this formulation is logically equivalent to requiring all three sides equal, so while the expression is non-standard, it is mathematically correct.\n\n* **Condition 2**: $L$ is a point on side $BC$ → `(hL : L ∈ segment ℝ B C)` → **✓ Perfect match**\n  The segment membership correctly captures that L lies on the line segment BC.\n\n* **Condition 3**: $M$ is a point on side $CA$ → `(hM : M ∈ segment ℝ C A)` → **✓ Perfect match**\n  The segment membership correctly captures that M lies on the line segment CA.\n\n* **Condition 4**: $N$ is a point on side $AB$ → `(hN : N ∈ segment ℝ A B)` → **✓ Perfect match**\n  The segment membership correctly captures that N lies on the line segment AB.\n\n* **Conclusion**: $MA \\cdot AN + NB \\cdot BL + LC \\cdot CM < BC^2$ → `dist M A * dist A N + dist N B * dist B L + dist L C * dist C M < dist B C ^ 2` → **✓ Perfect match**\n  The inequality is exactly preserved, with all distance products correctly translated using the `dist` function and the right-hand side properly squared.\n\n## 3. Final Conclusion\n\nThe Lean4 translation is mathematically consistent and logically equivalent to the original problem. Upon closer examination, the equilateral triangle condition, while expressed in a non-standard way, is mathematically correct since the two equality conditions `dist A B = dist A C ∧ dist A C = dist B C` do imply that all three sides are equal by transitivity. \n\nAll geometric objects are properly formalized using `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 2)` for 2D points, `segment` for line segments, and `dist` for Euclidean distances. The main inequality preserves the exact structure of the original problem, with all six distance terms correctly positioned and the quadratic term on the right side properly formalized.\n\nThe translation demonstrates appropriate Lean4 geometric formalization by:\n- Using the standard Euclidean space type for 2D geometry\n- Employing segment membership for points on sides\n- Using the `dist` function consistently for all distance measurements\n- Preserving the exact algebraic structure of the inequality\n\n## 4.

Final Conclusion\n\nThe Lean4 translation is mathematically consistent and logically equivalent to the original problem. While it doesn't explicitly declare the general relationship $R = gS - 4$ as a separate entity, it correctly captures the mathematical content through the specific instances used in the hypothesis and conclusion. \n\nThe formalization properly:\n- Treats $g$ as a constant (parameter) of type ℝ\n- Uses the given condition $S = 8, R = 16$ as a hypothesis\n- Structures the conclusion to prove the specific case $S = 10, R = 21$\n- Maintains the linear relationship implicitly through consistent application of the formula\n\nThe approach of using specific evaluations of the relationship rather than declaring it as a general function is mathematically sound and actually more direct for this particular proof problem.

The use of `IsGreatest` is a mathematically rigorous way to express that 249500 is indeed the maximum value in the set of all possible areas for rectangles satisfying the given constraints.\n\nThe translation demonstrates sophisticated mathematical formalization by:\n- Using set comprehension to define the space of all possible areas\n- Employing the `IsGreatest` predicate to formally capture the maximization concept\n- Correctly encoding the perimeter constraint and integer requirements\n- Maintaining the exact numerical values (1998 for perimeter, 249500 for maximum area)\n\nThe approach is mathematically sound and equivalent to the original problem statement, though it uses more formal mathematical language typical of theorem provers.\n\n## 4.

The conclusion accurately represents the target equation with proper type annotations to ensure real number arithmetic.\n\nThe formalization demonstrates good Lean4 practices by:\n- Using implicit parameter declaration `{x : ℝ}` for the variable\n- Employing `Real.sqrt` for square root operations\n- Including type annotations `(4 : ℝ)` to disambiguate the base in exponential expressions\n- Structuring the theorem as a direct implication from hypothesis to conclusion\n\nThe mathematical content is preserved exactly: given that the sum of square roots of $2^x$ and $2^{-x}$ equals 4, we need to prove that $4^x + 4^{-x} = 194$. This is a valid algebraic relationship that can be verified through substitution and algebraic manipulation.\n\n## 4. Assessment Result\n\n<box>match</box>",

This is a finite arithmetic sum that can be expressed using summation notation.\n\n**Step 2: Translating to Lean4 Summation**\nIn Lean4, we use `∑ i in Finset.range n, expr` for finite sums. Here:\n- `Finset.range 25` creates the finite set {0, 1, 2, ..., 24} (25 elements starting from 0)\n- Since we want to sum 1 to 25 (not 0 to 24), we use `(i + 1)` in the expression\n- This transforms the sum: when i ranges from 0 to 24, (i + 1) ranges from 1 to 25\n\n**Step 3: Verification of the Mapping**\n- Original: 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 25\n- Lean4: ∑ i in Finset.range 25, (i + 1)\n- When i = 0: (i + 1) = 1\n- When i = 1: (i + 1) = 2\n- ...\n- When i = 24: (i + 1) = 25\n\n**Step 4: Target Equality**\nThe theorem directly states the equality `= 325`, which corresponds exactly to the conclusion S = 325 in the original problem.

Final Conclusion + Error Analysis\n\nThe Lean4 translation is mathematically equivalent to the original problem, but uses an unnecessarily confusing and indirect approach. While `∑ i in Finset.range 25, (i + 1)` does correctly compute 1 + 2 + ... + 25 = 325, it's not the most natural or clear formalization. A more direct approach would be `∑ i in Finset.Icc 1 25, i` which directly sums from 1 to 25 inclusive, or `∑ i in Finset.range 26, i` which avoids the `(i + 1)` transformation.\n\nThe formalization preserves the mathematical content and logical structure, but the choice of indexing makes it less readable and potentially confusing.

We need to count the total number of digits used across all page numbers\n\nTo prove: The total number of digits required to number all pages from $1$ to $527$ is $1473$.\nnow begin translating\n**Original Problem Analysis:**\nThe problem asks to count the total digits needed to write all page numbers from 1 to 527, proving this sum equals 1473.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding Digit Counting**\n- Pages 1-9: 1 digit each (9 pages × 1 digit = 9 digits)\n- Pages 10-99: 2 digits each (90 pages × 2 digits = 180 digits)  \n- Pages 100-527: 3 digits each (428 pages × 3 digits = 1284 digits)\n- Total: 9 + 180 + 1284 = 1473 digits\n\n**Step 2: Lean4 Translation Components**\n- **Range**: `Finset.range 527` represents indices 0 to 526\n- **Page numbers**: `(i + 1)` converts index i to actual page number (1 to 527)\n- **Digit counting**: `(Nat.digits 10 (i + 1)).length` counts digits in base-10 representation\n- **Summation**: `∑ i ∈ Finset.range 527` sums over all page numbers\n\n**Step 3: Mathematical Structure**\nThe Lean4 formalization directly captures the combinatorial counting by:\n- Using `Nat.digits 10 n` to get the digit representation of number n in base 10\n- Taking `.length` to count how many digits\n- Summing across all page numbers from 1 to 527\n- Asserting the total equals exactly 1473\n\nThis approach elegantly handles the varying digit lengths (1, 2, or 3 digits) automatically through the `Nat.digits` function rather than manually partitioning by ranges.\n\n**Now the Final Lean Translation is:**\ntheorem number_of_pages : ∑ i ∈ Finset.range 527, (Nat.digits 10 (i + 1)).length = 1473 := by sorry\nnow verify whether the Lean4 theorem statement accurately captures the mathematical content of the original natural language problem and its structured decomposition.\n## 1. Overall Comparison\n\nThe Lean4 theorem captures the mathematical essence of the original problem but has a critical off-by-one error in the range specification. The problem asks for counting digits from pages 1 to 527 (inclusive), but the Lean4 formalization uses `Finset.range 527` which only includes pages 1 to 526, missing page 527 entirely.\n\n## 2. Condition-by-Condition Correspondence\n\n* **Condition 1**: Pages numbered from 1 to 527 → `∑ i ∈ Finset.range 527, ... (i + 1)` → **✗ Incorrect**\n  The `Finset.range 527` creates the set {0, 1, 2, ..., 526}, and with `(i + 1)` this gives pages {1, 2, 3, ..., 527}. However, this only includes 527 pages total but the range should be 527 pages from 1 to 527 inclusive, which means we need `Finset.range 527` to give us exactly 527 elements. The current formulation actually computes pages 1 through 526 only.\n\n* **Condition 2**: Each page requires digits to represent its number → `(Nat.digits 10 (i + 1)).length` → **✓ Perfect match**\n  The `Nat.digits 10` function correctly computes the decimal digit representation, and `.length` gives the count of digits needed.\n\n* **Condition 3**: Count total digits across all pages → `∑ i ∈ Finset.range 527, ...` → **✓ Conceptually correct**\n  The summation structure correctly represents counting total digits across all pages.\n\n* **Conclusion**: Total digits equals 1473 → `= 1473` → **✓ Perfect match**\n  The claimed result is correctly stated.\n\n## 3. Final Conclusion + Error Analysis\n\nThe Lean4 translation has the correct mathematical structure and approach for solving the digit counting problem, but contains a critical indexing error. The use of `Finset.range 527` creates a range from 0 to 526 (527 elements), and when mapped to page numbers via `(i + 1)`, this gives pages 1 to 527. However, this is actually correct upon closer inspection - `Finset.range 527` contains exactly the indices needed to represent all pages from 1 to 527.\n\nWait, let me reconsider: `Finset.range 527` gives {0, 1, 2, ..., 526}, which has 527 elements. When we apply `(i + 1)` to each element, we get {1, 2, 3, ..., 527}, which is exactly the page range we want. So the formalization is actually mathematically correct.\n\nThe translation properly captures the combinatorial counting problem, uses appropriate Lean4 functions for digit computation, and structures the proof goal correctly. All essential mathematical components are preserved.\n\n## 4. Assessment Result\n\n<box>match</box>",

We need to:\n- Calculate Anjali's total cents: 230 quarters + 300 dimes + 165 nickels\n- Calculate Niki's total cents: 210 quarters + 316 dimes + 173 nickels  \n- Show the difference is exactly 300 cents\n\n**Step 2: Mapping to Lean4 Parameters**\nThe coin counts are represented as natural numbers (a b c d e f : ℕ) with explicit value assignments:\n- Anjali's coins: a=230 quarters, b=300 dimes, c=165 nickels\n- Niki's coins: d=210 quarters, e=316 dimes, f=173 nickels\n- Coin values are hardcoded: quarters=25¢, dimes=10¢, nickels=5¢\n\n**Step 3: Formalizing the Conclusion**\nThe statement \"Anjali has 300 more cents than Niki\" translates to:\n- Anjali's total: `a * 25 + b * 10 + c * 5`\n- Niki's total: `d * 25 + e * 10 + f * 5`\n- Relationship: `Anjali_total = Niki_total + 300`\n\n**Step 4: Key Insight**\nThe Lean4 formalization captures this as a pure arithmetic equality verification. The proof will involve substituting the given values and performing the multiplication and addition to show both sides equal the same number (9075 cents vs 8775 + 300 cents).\n\n**Now the Final Lean Translation is:**\ntheorem anjali_niki (a b c d e f : ℕ)\n    (ha : a = 230) (hb : b = 300) (hc : c = 165)\n    (hd : d = 210) (he : e = 316) (hf : f = 173) :\n    (a * 25 + b * 10 + c * 5) = (d * 25 + e * 10 + f * 5) + 300 := by sorry\nnow verify whether the Lean4 theorem statement accurately captures the mathematical content of the original natural language problem and its structured decomposition.\n## 1. Overall Comparison\n\nThe Lean4 theorem captures the core mathematical content of the original problem by formalizing the coin counts and their conversion to cents. However, there are some structural differences in how the problem is parameterized and how the conclusion is stated that affect the directness of the correspondence.\n\n## 2. Condition-by-Condition Correspondence\n\n* **Condition 1**: Anjali has 230 quarters → `(a : ℕ) (ha : a = 230)` → **✓ Functionally equivalent**\n  The specific count is captured through parameter constraint, though using a more general parameterized approach.\n\n* **Condition 2**: Anjali has 300 dimes → `(b : ℕ) (hb : b = 300)` → **✓ Functionally equivalent**\n  Same parameterized approach as condition 1.\n\n* **Condition 3**: Anjali has 165 nickels → `(c : ℕ) (hc : c = 165)` → **✓ Functionally equivalent**\n  Consistent with the parameterization pattern.\n\n* **Condition 4**: Niki has 210 quarters → `(d : ℕ) (hd : d = 210)` → **✓ Functionally equivalent**\n  Niki's quarter count is properly parameterized.\n\n* **Condition 5**: Niki has 316 dimes → `(e : ℕ) (he : e = 316)` → **✓ Functionally equivalent**\n  Niki's dime count is correctly captured.\n\n* **Condition 6**: Niki has 173 nickels → `(f : ℕ) (hf : f = 173)` → **✓ Functionally equivalent**\n  Niki's nickel count is properly formalized.\n\n* **Condition 7**: Standard U.S. coin values → `* 25`, `* 10`, `* 5` in the expressions → **✓ Perfect match**\n  The cent values for quarters (25), dimes (10), and nickels (5) are correctly embedded in the calculation.\n\n* **Conclusion**: \"Anjali has 300 more cents than Niki\" → `(a * 25 + b * 10 + c * 5) = (d * 25 + e * 10 + f * 5) + 300` → **✓ Perfect match**\n  The mathematical relationship is correctly expressed as Anjali's total cents equals Niki's total cents plus 300.\n\n## 3. Final Conclusion\n\nThe Lean4 translation is mathematically consistent and logically equivalent to the original problem. While the formalization uses a more general parameterized approach rather than directly stating the specific numbers, this is a valid and often preferred approach in formal theorem proving as it makes the theorem more general and reusable. All coin counts are correctly constrained to their specific values through hypotheses, the standard coin values are properly incorporated, and the conclusion accurately captures the relationship that Anjali has exactly 300 more cents than Niki.\n\nThe formalization demonstrates good Lean4 practices by:\n- Using natural numbers (ℕ) for coin counts, which is appropriate\n- Separating the general structure from specific values through parameterization\n- Correctly computing total cents for both individuals\n- Expressing the \"300 more\" relationship as an equality\n\n## 4.

No quantifiers or complex logical structure needed - just a straightforward equation:\n`LHS = RHS` where LHS is the product of three sine terms and RHS is the exact value √3/8.\n\n**Step 4: Key Mathematical Insight**\nThe angles π/9, 2π/9, 4π/9 are chosen because they relate to roots of unity and polynomial identities. The proof would likely involve using properties of Chebyshev polynomials or the relationship between these angles and the regular enneagon (9-sided polygon).\n\n**Now the Final Lean Translation is:**\ntheorem Real.sin_tan : Real.sin (Real.pi / 9) * Real.sin (2 * Real.pi / 9) * Real.sin (4 * Real.pi / 9) = Real.sqrt 3 / 8 := by sorry\nnow verify whether the Lean4 theorem statement accurately captures the mathematical content of the original natural language problem and its structured decomposition.\n## 1. Overall Comparison\n\nThe Lean4 theorem captures the core mathematical content of the original problem, correctly formalizing the product of three sine functions and the target value. However, there are some issues with the theorem name and the implicit nature of the conditions in the formalization.\n\n## 2. Condition-by-Condition Correspondence\n\n* **Condition 1**: Working with sine functions of specific angles that are multiples of $\\frac{\\pi}{9}$ → `Real.sin (Real.pi / 9) * Real.sin (2 * Real.pi / 9) * Real.sin (4 * Real.pi / 9)` → **✓ Perfect match**\n  The Lean4 translation correctly uses the Real.sin function with the specified angle multiples of π/9.\n\n* **Condition 2**: The angles involved are $\\frac{\\pi}{9}$, $\\frac{2\\pi}{9}$, and $\\frac{4\\pi}{9}$ → `(Real.pi / 9)`, `(2 * Real.pi / 9)`, `(4 * Real.pi / 9)` → **✓ Perfect match**\n  All three specific angles are accurately represented in Lean4 syntax.\n\n* **Condition 3**: These angles are all in the first quadrant with positive sine values → *Implicit in Lean4 formalization* → **△ Acceptable but implicit**\n  While this condition is mathematically true and doesn't need explicit statement in Lean4 (since it's a property of the specific angles), it could be considered a minor omission in terms of explicit documentation.\n\n* **Conclusion**: $\\sin\\frac{\\pi}{9}\\sin\\frac{2\\pi}{9}\\sin\\frac{4\\pi}{9} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{8}$ → `Real.sin (Real.pi / 9) * Real.sin (2 * Real.pi / 9) * Real.sin (4 * Real.pi / 9) = Real.sqrt 3 / 8` → **✓ Perfect match**\n  The equality statement is exactly preserved, with proper Lean4 syntax for real numbers, sine functions, square root, and division.\n\n## 3. Final Conclusion\n\nThe Lean4 translation is mathematically consistent and logically equivalent to the original problem. The core mathematical statement is perfectly captured with accurate representations of all sine functions, angles, and the target value. The product structure and equality are correctly formalized.\n\nThe formalization appropriately uses Lean4's Real library functions and maintains the exact mathematical relationships. The implicit nature of condition 3 (angles being in first quadrant) is acceptable since this is a mathematical fact that doesn't require explicit hypothesis in the theorem statement.\n\nOne minor naming issue exists: the theorem is named `Real.sin_tan` but involves only sine functions, not tangent functions, which could be misleading. However, this doesn't affect the mathematical correctness of the statement itself.\n\n## 4. Assessment Result\n\n<box>match</box>",

The formalization correctly:\n- Identifies the mathematical object (200!)\n- Captures the divisibility relationship using the `∣` operator\n- Uses set comprehension to represent all valid exponents\n- Employs `IsGreatest` to formalize the concept of the maximum exponent\n\nThe `IsGreatest` predicate in Lean4 properly encodes both necessary conditions: (1) that 197 is in the set (meaning $2^{197}$ divides $200!$), and (2) that 197 is an upper bound for the set (meaning no power higher than $2^{197}$ divides $200!$). This precisely matches the mathematical definition of \"greatest power that divides evenly.\"\n\nThe translation demonstrates good mathematical formalization by using the appropriate Lean4 constructs for divisibility, set theory, and order relations. The structure correctly separates the computational aspect (finding powers that divide) from the extremal property (finding the greatest such power).\n\n## 4. Assessment Result\n\n<box>match</box>",

Condition-by-Condition Correspondence\n\n* **Condition 1**: $A = (a_{ij})_{1 \\leq i,j \\leq n} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ → `(A : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) ℝ)` → **✓ Perfect match**\n  The matrix type correctly represents an $n \\times n$ real matrix with appropriate indexing.\n\n* **Condition 2**: $\\sum_{j=1}^n a_{ij}^2 = i$ for $i = 1, 2, \\ldots, n$ → `(h : ∀ i, ∑ j : Fin n, (A i j)^2 = (i.1 + 1))` → **⚠ Needs verification**\n  The constraint structure is correct, but there's a critical indexing issue. In the original problem, row $i$ has sum of squares equal to $i$ where $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, n\\}$. In Lean4, `Fin n` represents indices $\\{0, 1, \\ldots, n-1\\}$, so `i.1` gives the natural number representation. The expression `(i.1 + 1)` converts from 0-based indexing to 1-based indexing, making row 0 have sum 1, row 1 have sum 2, etc. This correctly captures the original constraint.\n\n* **Additional condition**: The constraint `(hn : 0 < n)` → **✓ Reasonable addition**\n  This ensures $n$ is positive, which is necessary for the problem to be well-defined and for `Nat.factorial n` to make sense.\n\n* **Conclusion**: $|\\det(A)| \\leq \\sqrt{n!}$ → `|(A.det)| ≤ Real.sqrt (Nat.factorial n)` → **✓ Perfect match**\n  The determinant bound is exactly preserved, with appropriate absolute value and square root functions.\n\n## 3. Final Conclusion\n\nThe Lean4 translation is mathematically consistent and logically equivalent to the original problem. The key technical aspect is the index conversion: Lean4 uses 0-based indexing (`Fin n` = {0,1,...,n-1}) while the mathematical problem uses 1-based indexing ({1,2,...,n}). The formalization correctly handles this by using `(i.1 + 1)`, which ensures that:\n- Row 0 (first row) has sum of squares = 1\n- Row 1 (second row) has sum of squares = 2\n- ...\n- Row n-1 (last row) has sum of squares = n\n\nThis perfectly matches the original constraint where row $i$ has sum of squares equal to $i$ for $i = 1, 2, \\ldots, n$. The addition of the positivity constraint on $n$ is mathematically reasonable and necessary for the Lean4 formalization. All other aspects of the translation are accurate and preserve the mathematical content.\n\n## 4. Assessment Result\n\n<box>match</box>",

We need to show that the equation has solutions if and only if those solutions are exactly the permutations of (5,8,11).\n\n**Step 2: Capturing the Conditions**\n- Positive integers: In Lean4, we use `x y z : ℕ` with constraints `x > 0 ∧ y > 0 ∧ z > 0` to represent positive integers\n- The equation: `2 ^ x + 2 ^ y + 2 ^ z = 2336` directly translates the mathematical equation\n- The left side of the biconditional combines all constraints: positivity conditions AND the equation\n\n**Step 3: Formalizing \"Only Solutions\"**\nThe phrase \"only positive-integer solutions are the permutations of (5,8,11)\" means:\n- Forward direction: If there's a solution, then it must be one of the 6 permutations\n- Backward direction: Each of the 6 permutations is indeed a solution\nThis is captured by the biconditional structure with explicit enumeration of all 6 ordered triples.\n\n**Step 4: Handling Permutations**\nRather than using abstract permutation notation, Lean4 explicitly lists all 6 possible ordered arrangements: `(5,8,11) ∨ (5,11,8) ∨ (8,5,11) ∨ (8,11,5) ∨ (11,5,8) ∨ (11,8,5)`.

Final Conclusion + Error Analysis\n\nThe Lean4 translation is mathematically consistent with the original problem. The key difference is in logical structure: the original problem asks to \"prove that the only solutions are...\" (a one-directional statement), while the Lean4 version uses a biconditional (↔), which is actually stronger and more complete.\n\nThe biconditional structure means the theorem states both directions:\n1. If (x,y,z) satisfies the conditions, then it must be one of the six permutations\n2. If (x,y,z) is one of the six permutations, then it satisfies the conditions\n\nThis is mathematically sound and actually provides a more complete characterization than the original one-directional statement. The second direction (that the listed permutations are indeed solutions) is trivial to verify by substitution, while the first direction (that these are the only solutions) captures the essence of the original problem.\n\nThe use of natural numbers with positivity constraints instead of positive integers is a standard Lean4 approach and doesn't affect the mathematical content.

We assume that all men work at the same rate and the work rate is constant over time\n\nTo prove: The number of men required to complete the same project in 100 days is 104.\nnow begin translating\n**Step 1: Understanding the Work Rate Principle**\nThe core insight is that total work = number of men × number of days. Since it's the same project, the total work remains constant, giving us the equation: 80 × 130 = x × 100, where x is the unknown number of men.\n\n**Step 2: Translating to Lean4 Components**\n- Parameter: `x : ℕ` represents the unknown number of men (natural number since we can't have fractional people)\n- Constraint: `hx : x ≠ 0` ensures we have a positive number of men (realistic assumption)\n- Key equation: `h : 80 * 130 = x * 100` captures the work conservation principle\n- Goal: `x = 104` is the specific value we need to prove\n\n**Step 3: Mathematical Structure**\nThe problem reduces to solving a simple algebraic equation: 80 × 130 = x × 100, which gives x = (80 × 130) ÷ 100 = 10400 ÷ 100 = 104.

Overall Comparison\n\nThe Lean4 theorem captures the mathematical essence of the original work rate problem but with some limitations. It correctly identifies that this is fundamentally about the inverse relationship between number of workers and time (when total work is constant), and it properly formalizes the key equation `80 * 130 = x * 100`. However, the formalization misses some important contextual assumptions from the original problem.\n\n## 2.

Final Conclusion\n\nThe Lean4 translation is mathematically sound and logically consistent with the original problem. It correctly captures the core mathematical relationship (inverse proportionality between workers and time for constant work) and formalizes the key equation that governs work rate problems. The constraint `x ≠ 0` is a reasonable mathematical precaution.\n\nThe main limitation is that some contextual assumptions (uniform work rates, constant productivity) are implicit rather than explicit, but this is acceptable since these assumptions are standard in such problems and are embedded in the mathematical model itself. The formalization focuses on the essential mathematical content rather than all the contextual details.\n\nThe translation demonstrates appropriate mathematical modeling by:\n- Using natural numbers for counting men\n- Establishing the fundamental work equation\n- Including necessary non-zero constraints\n- Directly stating what needs to be proven\n\n## 4.

We have four consecutive whole numbers: $1735$, $1736$, $1737$, and $1738$\n2. These numbers are consecutive integers (each number is exactly 1 more than the previous number)\n\nTo prove: \n1. $1735$ is a multiple of $5$ (i.e., $5 \\mid 1735$)\n2. $1736$ is a multiple of $7$ (i.e., $7 \\mid 1736$)\n3. $1737$ is a multiple of $9$ (i.e., $9 \\mid 1737$)\n4. $1738$ is a multiple of $11$ (i.e., $11 \\mid 1738$)\nnow begin translating\nThe original problem asks us to verify divisibility properties for four specific consecutive integers: 1735, 1736, 1737, and 1738.\n\n**Step 1: Parameterization Strategy**\nInstead of treating each number separately, the Lean4 formalization uses a clever parameterization approach. It introduces `n : ℕ` with the constraint `h₀ : n = 1735`, then expresses the consecutive numbers as `n`, `n + 1`, `n + 2`, and `n + 3`. This captures the consecutive nature algebraically rather than listing each number explicitly.\n\n**Step 2: Translating Divisibility Claims**\nEach divisibility statement \"X is a multiple of Y\" translates directly to Lean4's divisibility notation `Y ∣ X`:\n- \"1735 is a multiple of 5\" becomes `5 ∣ n`\n- \"1736 is a multiple of 7\" becomes `7 ∣ (n + 1)`  \n- \"1737 is a multiple of 9\" becomes `9 ∣ (n + 2)`\n- \"1738 is a multiple of 11\" becomes `11 ∣ (n + 3)`\n\n**Step 3: Logical Structure**\nThe four separate claims are combined using conjunction (`∧`) to form a single compound statement. This reflects that we need to prove all four divisibility properties simultaneously.\n\n**Step 4: Computational Nature**\nThis is essentially a computational verification problem - given the specific value n = 1735, we can prove each divisibility by direct calculation (1735 ÷ 5 = 347, 1736 ÷ 7 = 248, etc.).\n\n**Now the Final Lean Translation is:**\ntheorem prove (n : ℕ) (h₀ : n = 1735) :\n    5 ∣ n ∧ 7 ∣ (n + 1) ∧ 9 ∣ (n + 2) ∧ 11 ∣ (n + 3) := by sorry\nnow verify whether the Lean4 theorem statement accurately captures the mathematical content of the original natural language problem and its structured decomposition.\n## 1. Overall Comparison\n\nThe Lean4 theorem captures the mathematical essence of the original problem by correctly formalizing the divisibility conditions for four consecutive integers starting at 1735. However, there is a structural inconsistency: the original problem presents these as four specific given numbers to verify, while the Lean4 formalization introduces an unnecessary parameter `n` and hypothesis `h₀ : n = 1735`, making it more general than needed.\n\n## 2. Condition-by-Condition Correspondence\n\n* **Condition 1**: Four consecutive whole numbers 1735, 1736, 1737, 1738 → `(n : ℕ) (h₀ : n = 1735)` with implicit consecutive structure `n, n+1, n+2, n+3` → **⚠ Partially correct**\n  The consecutive nature is correctly captured through `n+1, n+2, n+3`, but the parameterization is unnecessarily complex for what should be a direct verification of specific numbers.\n\n* **Condition 2**: These are consecutive integers → Implicit in the `n, n+1, n+2, n+3` structure → **✓ Correct**\n  The consecutive property is properly maintained through the arithmetic progression.\n\n* **Conclusion 1**: $5 \\mid 1735$ → `5 ∣ n` (where `n = 1735`) → **✓ Correct**\n  The divisibility condition is accurately represented.\n\n* **Conclusion 2**: $7 \\mid 1736$ → `7 ∣ (n + 1)` → **✓ Correct**\n  Correctly captures that 7 divides the second number in the sequence.\n\n* **Conclusion 3**: $9 \\mid 1737$ → `9 ∣ (n + 2)` → **✓ Correct**\n  Correctly captures that 9 divides the third number in the sequence.\n\n* **Conclusion 4**: $11 \\mid 1738$ → `11 ∣ (n + 3)` → **✓ Correct**\n  Correctly captures that 11 divides the fourth number in the sequence.\n\n## 3. Final Conclusion + Error Analysis\n\nThe Lean4 translation is mathematically consistent and logically equivalent to the original problem. All divisibility conditions are accurately captured, and the consecutive nature of the numbers is properly maintained through the arithmetic progression `n, n+1, n+2, n+3`. The conjunction structure correctly combines all four required divisibility statements.\n\nHowever, there is a stylistic inconsistency in the formalization approach. The original problem asks to verify specific properties of four explicitly given numbers (1735, 1736, 1737, 1738), which would be more naturally formalized as direct statements about these constants. The Lean4 version introduces unnecessary abstraction by parameterizing with `n` and then constraining it to equal 1735, when a more direct approach would simply state the divisibility conditions for the literal values.\n\nDespite this stylistic difference, the mathematical content is fully preserved, and the theorem statement is logically equivalent to the original problem. The formalization will prove exactly what is required: that these four consecutive numbers have the specified divisibility properties.\n\n## 4. Assessment Result\n\n<box>match</box>",

Overall Comparison\n\nThe Lean4 theorem captures the core mathematical relationship but has a significant structural issue. While it correctly identifies that the area of a square relates to its diagonal through the Pythagorean theorem, the formalization uses a side length parameter `a` that is not explicitly present in the original problem statement.

Final Conclusion + Error Analysis\n\nThe translation is mathematically sound and logically equivalent to the original problem, but it introduces an intermediate abstraction (side length `a`) that makes the formalization less direct than the original statement. The original problem asks to prove that a specific square with diagonal $12\\sqrt{2}$ has area $144$, while the Lean4 version proves that any square with side length `a` satisfying the diagonal constraint has the required area.\n\nHowever, this is actually a reasonable and mathematically valid approach to formalizing the problem, as it makes the geometric relationships explicit. The key insight that diagonal $d$ and side length $a$ satisfy $d^2 = 2a^2$ is correctly captured, and the conclusion that area equals $a^2 = 144$ follows logically.\n\nThe formalization is mathematically consistent and proves the same result, just with a slightly more general parametric approach rather than working directly with the specific numerical values.\n\n### 4.

This is the standard way to handle indexed sequences in Lean4.\n\nThe product constraint $(1+a_1)(1+a_2)\\cdots(1+a_n) = 2^n$ becomes `∏ i : Fin n, (1 + a i) = 2 ^ n`, using Lean's finite product notation.

Final Conclusion\n\nThe Lean4 translation is largely mathematically consistent and logically equivalent to the original problems.

We are working with the base $7 > 1$ (a constant greater than 1)\n2. We have four exponential expressions with base 7 and fractional exponents:\n   - $7^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ (where $\\frac{1}{2} = 0.5$)\n   - $7^{\\frac{1}{7}} \\approx 7^{0.143}$\n   - $7^{\\frac{1}{3}} \\approx 7^{0.333}$\n   - $7^{\\frac{1}{6}} \\approx 7^{0.167}$\n3. All exponents $\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{7}, \\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{6}$ are positive rational numbers\n\nTo prove: $7^{\\frac{1}{2}} + 7^{\\frac{1}{7}} > 7^{\\frac{1}{3}} + 7^{\\frac{1}{6}}$\nnow begin translating\n**Step 1: Understanding the Mathematical Structure**\nThe original problem asks to prove an inequality between two sums of exponential expressions with the same base (7) but different fractional exponents. This is a direct inequality statement without additional hypotheses or parameters.\n\n**Step 2: Identifying Lean4 Components**\n- Base: The constant `7` needs to be treated as a real number `(7 : ℝ)` to work with real exponentiation\n- Exponents: Each fraction like `1/2` becomes `(1 : ℝ) / 2` to ensure real division rather than natural number operations\n- Operations: Real exponentiation `^` and real addition `+` \n- Goal: A direct inequality `>` between two real expressions\n\n**Step 3: Type System Considerations**\nThe key insight is that Lean4's type system requires explicit type annotations. Without `(7 : ℝ)` and `(1 : ℝ)`, Lean would interpret these as natural numbers, making exponentiation and division behave differently. The real number casting ensures we're working in the continuous real number system where exponential functions have their expected properties.\n\n**Step 4: Logical Structure Translation**\nUnlike the previous example with quantifiers and existence statements, this is a straightforward computational inequality. The theorem statement directly mirrors the mathematical expression: `LHS > RHS` where both sides are explicit real number computations. No additional hypotheses or complex logical structure is needed.\n\n**Now the Final Lean Translation is:**\ntheorem q : (7 : ℝ) ^ ((1 : ℝ) / 2) + (7 ^ ((1 : ℝ) / 7)) > (7 ^ ((1 : ℝ) / 3)) + (7 ^ ((1 : ℝ) / 6)) := by sorry\nnow verify whether the Lean4 theorem statement accurately captures the mathematical content of the original natural language problem and its structured decomposition.\n## 1. Overall Comparison\n\nThe Lean4 theorem captures the core mathematical content of the original problem by directly formalizing the inequality to be proven. However, the translation is somewhat minimal - it focuses purely on the computational statement without explicitly capturing the contextual conditions mentioned in the decomposed structure. The essential mathematical relationship is preserved, but some of the explanatory context is implicit rather than explicit.\n\n## 2. Condition-by-Condition Correspondence\n\n* **Condition 1**: Base $7 > 1$ → `(7 : ℝ)` → **✓ Adequate match**\n  The base 7 is correctly represented as a real number. While the condition $7 > 1$ is not explicitly stated, it's mathematically implicit and doesn't need formal declaration since 7 > 1 is obviously true.\n\n* **Condition 2**: Four exponential expressions with base 7 and fractional exponents → `(7 : ℝ) ^ ((1 : ℝ) / 2)`, `(7 ^ ((1 : ℝ) / 7))`, `(7 ^ ((1 : ℝ) / 3))`, `(7 ^ ((1 : ℝ) / 6))` → **✓ Perfect match**\n  All four exponential expressions are correctly formalized with explicit type annotations ensuring real number arithmetic. The fractional exponents are properly represented as divisions.\n\n* **Condition 3**: All exponents are positive rational numbers → Implicit in `((1 : ℝ) / 2)`, `((1 : ℝ) / 7)`, `((1 : ℝ) / 3)`, `((1 : ℝ) / 6)` → **✓ Adequate match**\n  While not explicitly stated as conditions, the exponents are clearly positive rationals (1/2, 1/7, 1/3, 1/6). The positivity is evident from the expressions themselves.\n\n* **Conclusion**: $7^{\\frac{1}{2}} + 7^{\\frac{1}{7}} > 7^{\\frac{1}{3}} + 7^{\\frac{1}{6}}$ → `(7 : ℝ) ^ ((1 : ℝ) / 2) + (7 ^ ((1 : ℝ) / 7)) > (7 ^ ((1 : ℝ) / 3)) + (7 ^ ((1 : ℝ) / 6))` → **✓ Perfect match**\n  The inequality is exactly preserved with proper type annotations and parentheses for clarity.\n\n## 3. Final Conclusion\n\nThe Lean4 translation is mathematically consistent and logically equivalent to the original problem. The core inequality statement is precisely captured with appropriate type annotations to ensure real number arithmetic. While the formalization doesn't explicitly state some of the contextual conditions from the decomposed structure (like $7 > 1$ or the positivity of exponents), these are either mathematically obvious or implicit in the expressions themselves.\n\nThe translation demonstrates good Lean4 practices by:\n- Using explicit type annotations `(7 : ℝ)` and `((1 : ℝ) / 2)` to ensure real number operations\n- Properly representing fractional exponents as divisions\n- Maintaining the exact structure of the inequality\n- Using appropriate parentheses for mathematical clarity\n\nThe formalization is minimal but complete - it captures exactly what needs to be proven without unnecessary additional hypotheses that are either trivially true or implicit in the statement itself.\n\n## 4.

If James cuts 1 tree in 5 hours, his rate is 1/5 trees per hour.\n\n**Step 2: Mathematical Structure**\nWhen working together, their combined rate is: a + b = 1/3 + 1/5 trees per hour\nTo find time for 1 tree: time = work/rate = 1/(a + b) hours\n\n**Step 3: Lean4 Formalization Mapping**\n- Parameters: `a b : ℝ` represent the individual work rates\n- Constraints: `ha : 0 < a ∧ a = 1 / 3` captures Bob's positive rate of 1/3 trees/hour\n- Constraints: `hb : 0 < b ∧ b = 1 / 5` captures James's positive rate of 1/5 trees/hour  \n- Goal: `1 / (a + b) = 15 / 8` represents the time formula where:\n  - `a + b` is the combined work rate\n  - `1 / (a + b)` is the time to complete 1 tree together\n  - `15 / 8` is the expected result (1.875 hours)\n\n**Step 4: Key Insight**\nThe Lean4 formalization directly encodes the work rate arithmetic: 1/(1/3 + 1/5) = 1/(8/15) = 15/8, avoiding intermediate steps and focusing on the core mathematical relationship.\n\n**Now the Final Lean Translation is:**\ntheorem parallel_catching (a b : ℝ) (ha : 0 < a ∧ a = 1 / 3) (hb : 0 < b ∧ b = 1 / 5) :\n    1 / (a + b) = 15 / 8 := by sorry\nnow verify whether the Lean4 theorem statement accurately captures the mathematical content of the original natural language problem and its structured decomposition.\n## 1. Overall Comparison\n\nThe Lean4 theorem captures the mathematical essence of the original problem by formalizing work rates and the combined work calculation. However, there are some issues with the abstraction level and parameter representation that affect the direct correspondence to the original problem statement.\n\n## 2. Condition-by-Condition Correspondence\n\n* **Condition 1**: Bob can cut a tree in 3 hours (rate = 1/3 trees/hour) → `(ha : 0 < a ∧ a = 1 / 3)` → **✓ Mathematically correct**\n  The work rate is correctly captured as 1/3, though the variable name 'a' is abstract rather than descriptive.\n\n* **Condition 2**: James can cut a tree in 5 hours (rate = 1/5 trees/hour) → `(hb : 0 < b ∧ b = 1 / 5)` → **✓ Mathematically correct**\n  The work rate is correctly captured as 1/5, with appropriate positivity constraint.\n\n* **Condition 3**: Bob and James work together simultaneously → **⚠ Implicit in the formulation**\n  This condition is implicitly captured in the addition `a + b` in the conclusion, but not explicitly stated as a hypothesis.\n\n* **Condition 4**: Work rates are additive when working together → **⚠ Implicit in the formulation**\n  This fundamental assumption is embedded in the expression `a + b` but not explicitly stated as a hypothesis.\n\n* **Conclusion**: Time for both working together is 15/8 hours → `1 / (a + b) = 15 / 8` → **✓ Mathematically correct**\n  The conclusion correctly applies the formula: time = 1/(combined rate) = 1/(1/3 + 1/5) = 15/8.\n\n## 3. Final Conclusion\n\nThe Lean4 translation is mathematically consistent and captures the core calculation correctly. The formula `1 / (a + b) = 15/8` properly represents that when two workers with rates a and b work together, their combined time is the reciprocal of their sum of rates. The specific values a = 1/3 and b = 1/5 correctly correspond to Bob's and James's individual work rates.\n\nHowever, the formalization has some minor issues:\n- The variable names 'a' and 'b' are generic rather than descriptive\n- The assumptions about simultaneous work and additive rates are implicit rather than explicit\n- The theorem name \"parallel_catching\" doesn't clearly relate to tree cutting\n\nDespite these presentation issues, the mathematical content is accurate and the proof obligation correctly captures what needs to be demonstrated: that 1/(1/3 + 1/5) = 15/8.\n\n## 4.

Final Conclusion + Error Analysis\n\nThe Lean4 translation is mathematically equivalent to the original problem and will prove the same result. However, it introduces unnecessary complexity by parameterizing the sleep fraction as x rather than using 5/13 directly. The original problem is essentially asking to verify that 377 × (5/13) = 145, which could be more directly formalized as:\n\n```lean\ntheorem joe_sleeps : (5 / 13 : ℝ) * 377 = 145 := by sorry\n```\n\nThe current formalization, while correct, adds an extra layer of abstraction that makes the theorem statement less direct and clear.

It correctly formalizes the continuous function on the closed interval [-1,1], preserves the integral inequality structure, and maintains the quantification over all such continuous functions. However, there are some technical discrepancies in how the function domain and integration are handled.\n\n## 2. Condition-by-Condition Correspondence\n\n* **Condition 1**: $f: [-1,1] \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ is continuous → `(f : ℝ → ℝ) (hf : ContinuousOn f (Icc (-1) 1))` → **⚠ Partial match with technical issue**\n  The original specifies f as a function with domain [-1,1], but Lean4 declares f as ℝ → ℝ and then restricts continuity to the interval. This creates a domain mismatch where f is defined on all reals but only continuous on [-1,1].\n\n* **Conclusion**: The inequality $\\int_{-1}^1 f^2(x) \\, dx \\geq \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\int_{-1}^1 f(x) \\, dx \\right)^2 + \\frac{3}{2} \\left( \\int_{-1}^1 x f(x) \\, dx \\right)^2$ → `∫ x in Icc (-1) 1, (f x)^2 ≥ (1/2) * (∫ x in Icc (-1) 1, f x)^2 + (3/2) * (∫ x in Icc (-1) 1, x * f x)^2` → **✓ Perfect match**\n  The inequality structure, coefficients (1/2 and 3/2), and integration bounds are all correctly preserved. The Lean4 syntax accurately represents the mathematical expressions.\n\n## 3. Final Conclusion + Error Analysis\n\nThe translation is largely mathematically consistent and captures the core inequality correctly. The main issue is a domain specification mismatch: the original problem defines f specifically on [-1,1], while the Lean4 version defines f on all reals and only requires continuity on [-1,1]. This could potentially allow f to be discontinuous or undefined outside [-1,1] in ways that might affect the mathematical interpretation.\n\nHowever, for the purposes of proving the integral inequality, this difference may not be practically significant since the integrals are only evaluated on [-1,1]. The mathematical content of the inequality itself is perfectly preserved.\n\nThe Lean4 formalization demonstrates good practices by using `ContinuousOn` for interval continuity and `Icc (-1) 1` for the closed interval representation.\n\n<error>Function domain mismatch: original defines f: [-1,1] → ℝ but Lean4 uses f: ℝ → ℝ with continuity only on [-1,1].</error>\n\n## 4.

The biconditional structure (`↔`) properly captures the claim that the given values are exactly the solutions - no more, no less. While the domain condition from the decomposed structure is not explicitly stated, this is handled appropriately by Lean's type system and the properties of `Real.sqrt`. The formalization is actually more elegant than explicitly stating domain conditions, as the biconditional will naturally only hold when both sides are mathematically meaningful and equal.\n\nThe use of `Real.sqrt` ensures proper handling of the square root function, and the biconditional structure correctly captures both the forward direction (if equation holds, then x ∈ {-1, -4}) and the backward direction (if x ∈ {-1, -4}, then equation holds), which together establish that these are exactly the solutions.\n\n## 4.

Final Conclusion\n\nThe Lean4 translation is mathematically consistent and logically equivalent to the original problem. The formalization correctly:\n\n- Uses the surface area formula for a cube (6 times the square of edge length)\n- Represents the doubling of edge length appropriately\n- Expresses the 300% increase as a ratio of 4:1 between new and old surface areas\n- Maintains the essential mathematical relationship that needs to be proven\n\nThe approach of using a direct ratio calculation `(6 * (2 * l)^2) / (6 * l^2) = 4` is mathematically sound and equivalent to showing that if the original surface area is $A_1 = 6l^2$ and the new surface area is $A_2 = 6(2l)^2 = 24l^2$, then $A_2 = 4A_1$, representing a 300% increase.\n\nThe expression `1 + 300 / 100` clearly breaks down the concept of \"300% increase\" as the original amount (1) plus the increase (300/100 = 3), totaling 4 times the original.\n\n## 4.

For primes of the form $4k + 3$: Let $q_1, q_2, \\ldots, q_s$ be a finite collection of such primes\n\nTo prove: \n1. There are infinitely many prime numbers of the form $4k + 1$\n2. There are infinitely many prime numbers of the form $4k + 3$\n\nSpecifically:\n- For any finite set of primes $\\{p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_t\\}$ of the form $4k + 1$, there exists another prime $p_{t+1}$ of the same form $4k + 1$ that is not in the original set\n- For any finite set of primes $\\{q_1, q_2, \\ldots, q_s\\}$ of the form $4k + 3$, there exists another prime $q_{s+1}$ of the same form $4k + 3$ that is not in the original set\nnow begin translating\nThe original problem asks to prove infinitely many primes exist in two specific arithmetic progressions (4k+1 and 4k+3) using a constructive approach - given any finite collection, find another prime of the same form.\n\n**Step 1: Translating Arithmetic Forms**\n- \"4k + 1\" becomes `4 * k + 1` in Lean4\n- \"4k + 3\" becomes `4 * k + 3` in Lean4\n- The existential quantification `∃ k, p = 4 * k + 1` captures \"p is of the form 4k+1\"\n\n**Step 2: From Constructive to Set-Theoretic**\nThe original problem uses a constructive approach (given finite list, find another), but Lean4 formalizes this more elegantly using set theory:\n- `{p : ℕ | p.Prime ∧ ∃ k, p = 4 * k + 1}` defines the set of all primes of form 4k+1\n- `.Infinite` directly captures \"infinitely many exist\"\n\n**Step 3: Logical Equivalence**\nThe set-theoretic formulation `.Infinite` is logically equivalent to the constructive statement: a set is infinite iff for any finite subset, there exists an element not in that subset. This bridges the gap between \"given p₁,...,pₜ, find pₜ₊₁\" and \"the set is infinite.\"\n\n**Step 4: Conjunction Structure**\nThe theorem uses `∧` to combine both statements, proving infinitude for both arithmetic progressions simultaneously, matching the \"specifically\" requirement in the original problem.\n\n**Now the Final Lean Translation is:**\ntheorem Infinite_primes :\n    {p : ℕ | p.Prime ∧ ∃ k, p = 4 * k + 1}.Infinite ∧\n    {p : ℕ | p.Prime ∧ ∃ k, p = 4 * k + 3}.Infinite := by sorry\nnow verify whether the Lean4 theorem statement accurately captures the mathematical content of the original natural language problem and its structured decomposition.\n## 1. Overall Comparison\n\nThe Lean4 theorem captures the core mathematical content of the original problem by correctly formalizing the infinitude of primes in both forms 4k+1 and 4k+3. However, it takes a more direct approach by stating the infinitude directly rather than following the constructive proof strategy outlined in the original problem's \"specifically\" section.\n\n## 2. Condition-by-Condition Correspondence\n\n* **Condition 1**: Prime numbers of form $4k + 1$ where $k$ is non-negative → `{p : ℕ | p.Prime ∧ ∃ k, p = 4 * k + 1}` → **✓ Perfect match**\n  The set comprehension correctly captures primes of the form 4k+1, though the existential quantification implicitly allows any natural number k (which includes the non-negative constraint).\n\n* **Condition 2**: Prime numbers of form $4k + 3$ where $k$ is non-negative → `{p : ℕ | p.Prime ∧ ∃ k, p = 4 * k + 3}` → **✓ Perfect match**\n  Similarly, the set comprehension correctly captures primes of the form 4k+3.\n\n* **Condition 3**: Finite collection $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_t$ of primes of form $4k + 1$ → **Not explicitly present** → **△ Implicit**\n  The Lean4 formalization doesn't explicitly mention finite collections, but the infinitude statement implicitly covers this by asserting that no finite collection can exhaust all such primes.\n\n* **Condition 4**: Finite collection $q_1, q_2, \\ldots, q_s$ of primes of form $4k + 3$ → **Not explicitly present** → **△ Implicit**\n  Same as condition 3, this is implicitly covered by the infinitude assertion.\n\n* **Conclusion Part 1**: Infinitely many primes of form $4k + 1$ → `{p : ℕ | p.Prime ∧ ∃ k, p = 4 * k + 1}.Infinite` → **✓ Perfect match**\n  The infinitude is directly and correctly stated using Lean4's `.Infinite` property.\n\n* **Conclusion Part 2**: Infinitely many primes of form $4k + 3$ → `{p : ℕ | p.Prime ∧ ∃ k, p = 4 * k + 3}.Infinite` → **✓ Perfect match**\n  Similarly, the infinitude is correctly formalized.\n\n* **Specific constructive statements**: For any finite set, there exists another prime not in the set → **Not explicitly present** → **△ Logically equivalent but different formulation**\n  The original problem emphasizes a constructive proof approach (given finite set, find another prime), while Lean4 uses direct infinitude assertion. These are logically equivalent but represent different proof strategies.\n\n## 3. Final Conclusion\n\nThe Lean4 translation is mathematically consistent and logically equivalent to the original problem. While the original problem suggests a constructive proof approach (explicitly mentioning finite collections and finding additional primes), the Lean4 formalization takes the more direct route of asserting infinitude using set theory. Both formulations are equivalent since a set is infinite if and only if for any finite subset, there exists an element not in that subset.\n\nThe translation correctly:\n- Identifies the two relevant sets of primes (4k+1 and 4k+3 forms)\n- Uses proper Lean4 syntax for set comprehension and prime numbers\n- Employs the `.Infinite` property which is the standard way to express infinitude in Lean4\n- Captures both parts of the conclusion with appropriate conjunction\n\nThe only minor consideration is that the constructive nature emphasized in the original problem's \"specifically\" section is not explicitly reflected, but this doesn't affect mathematical correctness since infinitude and the constructive property are equivalent.\n\n## 4.

Final Conclusion + Error Analysis\n\nThe Lean4 translation is mathematically consistent with the original problem in terms of the core equation and conclusion. However, there is a logical structural issue: the hypothesis `h : 95 - 5 * x = 60` essentially assumes that there exists some x satisfying the equation, and then asks to prove that this x equals 7. This creates a circular reasoning pattern where the existence of a solution is assumed rather than derived from the physical setup.\n\nA more natural formalization would either:\n1. Start from the physical conditions and derive the equation, or  \n2. Prove both existence and uniqueness of the solution\n\nAdditionally, the constraint `hx : x > 0` is reasonable (negative weeks don't make physical sense) but could be strengthened to ensure x represents a valid time period.\n\n<error>The theorem assumes the existence of a solution to the equation rather than deriving it from the physical temperature decrease conditions.</error>\n\n## 4.

The current formalization is technically correct but could be more elegant.\n\nThe trigonometric expressions are perfectly preserved, and the logical structure of the double inequality is correctly captured as a conjunction.

The infinite sum formalization using natural numbers with a conditional is more complex than necessary\n2. Missing convergence conditions for the infinite series\n3. No specification of the type of convergence (pointwise, uniform, L²)\n4. The function behavior at boundary points (x = 0, ±4) is not explicitly addressed\n\nDespite these issues, the core mathematical content is preserved and the theorem statement would be provable given appropriate convergence theorems for Fourier series.\n\n## 4.

Final Conclusion\n\nThe Lean4 translation is mathematically consistent and captures the essential content of the original problem. The domain restriction is properly formalized using the open interval notation, and the inequality statement is accurately translated. \n\nThe main concern is whether Lean4's `cot` function definition properly handles the domain restrictions. In standard mathematical libraries, cotangent is typically defined as `cos x / sin x` with appropriate domain restrictions. For the given interval $(0, \\pi)$, both $\\sin \\alpha$ and $\\sin(\\alpha/4)$ are indeed non-zero, so the cotangent functions are well-defined. The Lean4 formalization implicitly relies on the library's proper handling of these domain conditions.\n\nThe translation maintains the logical structure of the original problem: given a constraint on α, prove an inequality involving cotangent functions. The formalization is mathematically sound and would be provable using appropriate trigonometric identities and inequalities.\n\n## 4. Assessment Result\n\n<box>match</box>",

The minimum value of the sequence $\\{x_n\\}$ is $-\\dfrac{1}{6}$\nnow begin translating\n**Step 1: Understanding the Sequence Structure**\nThe original problem defines a sequence $x_n = \\frac{2^n - 3^n}{6^n}$ for $n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\cup \\{0\\}$. In Lean4, this maps to a function `x : ℕ → ℝ` with the defining property `hx : ∀ n, x n = (2^n - 3^n)/6^n`. Note that Lean4's `ℕ` includes 0, so it naturally captures $\\mathbb{N} \\cup \\{0\\}$.\n\n**Step 2: Translating \"Maximum/Minimum Value\" Concepts**\nWhen the problem states \"maximum value is 0\" and \"minimum value is -1/6\", it means:\n- There exists some term in the sequence equal to 0, and no term exceeds 0\n- There exists some term in the sequence equal to -1/6, and no term is less than -1/6\n\n**Step 3: Lean4 Formalization Strategy**\nThe key insight is using `Set.range x` to represent all possible values of the sequence. Then:\n- `IsGreatest (Set.range x) 0` captures: 0 is in the range AND 0 is an upper bound for all values\n- `IsLeast (Set.range x) (-1/6)` captures: -1/6 is in the range AND -1/6 is a lower bound for all values\n\n**Step 4: Logical Structure**\nThe conjunction `∧` combines both extremal properties, expressing that the sequence simultaneously achieves its maximum at 0 and minimum at -1/6. This elegant formalization avoids explicitly quantifying over sequence indices by working directly with the value set.\n\n**Now the Final Lean Translation is:**\ntheorem max_min (x : ℕ → ℝ) (hx : ∀ n, x n = (2^n - 3^n)/6^n) :\n    IsGreatest (Set.range x) 0 ∧ IsLeast (Set.range x) (-1/6) :=\nsorry\nnow verify whether the Lean4 theorem statement accurately captures the mathematical content of the original natural language problem and its structured decomposition.\n## 1.

Final Conclusion\n\nThe Lean4 translation is mathematically consistent and logically equivalent to the original problem. The formalization uses `IsGreatest` and `IsLeast` predicates on `Set.range x`, which is the mathematically rigorous way to express that certain values are the maximum and minimum of a sequence. This approach correctly captures both requirements: (1) that the extreme values are actually achieved by the sequence (membership in the range), and (2) that they bound all other values in the sequence.\n\nThe translation demonstrates good mathematical formalization by:\n- Using `Set.range x` to represent the set of all values taken by the sequence\n- Employing `IsGreatest` and `IsLeast` which combine existence (the value is achieved) with the extremal property\n- Correctly handling the domain as natural numbers including 0\n- Preserving the exact algebraic expression for the sequence\n\nThe formalization is more precise than a naive translation might be, as it ensures that the claimed extreme values are actually attained by the sequence, not just upper/lower bounds.\n\n## 4.

Final Conclusion\n\nThe Lean4 translation is mathematically consistent and logically equivalent to the original problem. All angle measurements are correctly converted from degrees to radians, maintaining the exact mathematical relationships. The trigonometric identity structure is preserved perfectly, with each reciprocal term properly formalized. The formalization demonstrates good Lean4 practices by using the standard radian-based trigonometric functions and appropriate arithmetic operations for division.\n\nThe translation successfully captures:\n- The specific angle values through accurate degree-to-radian conversion\n- The reciprocal nature of each term using division notation\n- The additive structure on the left side of the equation\n- The equality relationship with the single term on the right side\n\n## 4.

The theorem asserts that after solving all cases and removing duplicates, exactly 2 distinct real solutions remain.\n\n**Now the Final Lean Translation is:**\ntheorem number_of_solutions : Set.ncard {x : ℝ | abs (x - abs (2 * x + 1)) = 3} = 2 := by sorry\nnow verify whether the Lean4 theorem statement accurately captures the mathematical content of the original natural language problem and its structured decomposition.\n## 1.

The mathematical objects and relationships are preserved, and the formalization maintains the problem's core meaning of counting distinct real solutions.\n\n## 2.

The set comprehension accurately represents the collection of pairs satisfying all conditions, and the cardinality assertion properly formalizes the counting claim.\n\nHowever, there is a minor type inconsistency: the original problem specifies \"integers\" while the Lean4 formalization uses natural numbers (`ℕ`). In this specific context, since we have the constraint $0 < x < y$, both x and y must be positive, so natural numbers are actually appropriate and the constraint $0 < x$ ensures we're working with positive natural numbers. This doesn't create a mathematical error but represents a slight deviation from the literal specification.\n\nThe formalization correctly handles the interaction between natural number arithmetic and real-valued square root functions, and the overall logical structure (existence counting) is properly captured.\n\n## 4.

This suggests the solutions might have special trigonometric properties.\n\n**Step 2: Translating \"Possible Values\" to Lean**\nWhen we say \"the possible values of $x$ are ...\", we mean:\n- For each listed value, there exist corresponding $y,z$ satisfying the system\n- No other values of $x$ can satisfy the system with any choice of $y,z$\n\nThis translates to a biconditional (↔) statement in Lean.\n\n**Step 3: Lean Formalization Strategy**\n- Left side: `∃ y z, [system equations]` captures \"x is a possible value\"\n- Right side: Disjunction of all seven specific values using `∨`\n- The biconditional `↔` ensures completeness: these are exactly all solutions\n\n**Step 4: Key Insight**\nThe appearance of $\\tan(\\frac{k\\pi}{7})$ for $k=1,2,3,4,5,6$ plus $0$ suggests this system is related to the 7th roots of unity or trigonometric identities involving 7, which explains why the solution set has this specific trigonometric form.\n\n**Now the Final Lean Translation is:**\ntheorem tan_value (x : ℝ) :\n  ∃ y z, 2*x + x^2*y = y ∧ 2*y + y^2*z = z ∧ 2*z + z^2*x = x ↔\n  x = tan (π/7) ∨ x = tan (2*π/7) ∨ x = tan (3*π/7) ∨\n  x = tan (4*π/7) ∨ x = tan (5*π/7) ∨ x = tan (6*π/7) ∨\n  x = 0 := by sorry\nnow verify whether the Lean4 theorem statement accurately captures the mathematical content of the original natural language problem and its structured decomposition.\n## 1.

Final Conclusion\n\nThe Lean4 translation is mathematically consistent and logically equivalent to the original problem. The biconditional structure (`↔`) correctly formalizes the claim that these are exactly \"the possible values\" - the left-to-right direction shows these values work, while the right-to-left direction ensures completeness (no other values are possible).\n\nThe formalization properly:\n- Uses existential quantification to express that for each valid $x$, there exist corresponding $y,z$\n- Employs conjunction to represent the simultaneous satisfaction of all three equations  \n- Uses disjunction to enumerate the complete set of solutions\n- Maintains the exact trigonometric expressions with proper syntax\n- Structures the theorem as a characterization (biconditional) rather than just an implication\n\nThe mathematical content, logical structure, and scope are all preserved accurately.

However, for a quadratic function $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$, we have $f'(x) = 2ax + b$. Setting this to zero gives $x = -\\frac{b}{2a}$. But with the given condition $c = \\frac{b^2}{4a}$, the quadratic becomes a perfect square: $f(x) = a(x + \\frac{b}{2a})^2$, which touches the x-axis at $x = -\\frac{b}{2a}$ where $f(x) = 0$ but $f'(x) = 0$ as well.\n\n  Actually, upon further analysis, this is mathematically correct! When $c = \\frac{b^2}{4a}$, the discriminant $\\Delta = b^2 - 4ac = b^2 - 4a \\cdot \\frac{b^2}{4a} = 0$, giving exactly one root (a double root), and at this point both the function and its derivative are zero.\n\n## 3. Final Conclusion\n\nUpon careful mathematical analysis, the Lean4 translation is actually mathematically consistent and correct. The condition $c = \\frac{b^2}{4a}$ ensures that the discriminant is zero, making the quadratic a perfect square with a double root. At this double root, both the function value and its derivative are zero, which is precisely the condition for tangency to the x-axis. The formalization correctly captures that tangency means the graph touches the x-axis at exactly one point where the derivative is also zero (indicating the curve doesn't cross the axis but merely touches it).\n\nThe translation properly formalizes all given conditions and provides a mathematically rigorous definition of what it means for a parabola to be tangent to the x-axis.\n\n## 4.

However, there are two technical concerns:\n\n1. **Division semantics**: The use of natural number division could theoretically cause issues, though in this specific context it should work correctly since $\\gcd(x,y)$ divides $x+y$.\n\n2. **Edge case handling**: The case $k=1$ creates a degenerate situation where $2^k(2^k-1) = 2^k$, resulting in a singleton set rather than a two-element set. This suggests the original problem likely has an implicit assumption that $k > 1$ or needs special handling for small values of $k$.\n\nThe core mathematical logic and structure are preserved, making this a reasonable formalization despite these technical nuances.\n\n<error>The formalization may not handle the edge case k=1 correctly, where the claimed two-element set becomes a singleton.</error>\n\n## 4.

But for x = 3, y = 6: gcd(3,6) = 3, but the formula gives 2 * (⌊6/3⌋ + ⌊12/3⌋) + 3 + 6 - 18 = 2 * (2 + 4) + 3 + 6 - 18 = 12 + 9 - 18 = 3. Actually, let me recalculate: for x = 4, y = 6: gcd(4,6) = 2, but the formula gives 2 * (⌊6/4⌋ + ⌊12/4⌋ + ⌊18/4⌋) + 4 + 6 - 24 = 2 * (1 + 3 + 4) + 10 - 24 = 16 + 10 - 24 = 2. The formula might actually be correct, but it's highly non-obvious and would require proof.\n\n## 3. Final Conclusion + Error Analysis\n\nUpon closer examination, while the Lean4 translation accurately captures all the structural elements of the original problem, the mathematical formula itself appears to be either incorrect or requires very sophisticated proof techniques that are not immediately apparent. The translation is syntactically and structurally perfect, but the semantic content (the mathematical claim) seems problematic. Given that this appears to be a direct translation of the stated problem, the issue lies with the original mathematical claim rather than the Lean4 formalization itself. The Lean4 code faithfully represents what was asked to be proven, even if the underlying mathematical statement may be false.\n\n<error>The mathematical formula appears to produce incorrect results for basic test cases, making the theorem likely unprovable.</error>\n\n## 4.

In Lean4, this is elegantly expressed using the open interval notation `Ioo 0 (π / 2)`, where `Ioo` represents an open interval (excluding endpoints). The membership relation `∈` captures each angle being in this interval: `h₀ : α ∈ Ioo 0 (π / 2)`, etc.\n\n**Step 2: Formalizing the Constraint Equation**\nThe constraint $\\sin \\alpha + \\sin \\beta + \\sin \\gamma = 1$ translates directly to Lean4 as `h₃ : sin α + sin β + sin γ = 1`. This preserves the exact mathematical relationship without modification.\n\n**Step 3: Expressing the Inequality Goal**\nThe target inequality $\\tan^2 \\alpha + \\tan^2 \\beta + \\tan^2 \\gamma \\geq \\frac{3}{8}$ becomes `tan α ^ 2 + tan β ^ 2 + tan γ ^ 2 ≥ 3 / 8` in Lean4. Note that exponentiation is denoted by `^` and the fraction is written as `3 / 8`.\n\n**Step 4: Mathematical Structure Insight**\nThis is a constrained optimization problem where we seek to minimize a sum of squares subject to a trigonometric constraint. The acute angle restrictions ensure that all trigonometric functions are well-defined and positive, avoiding issues with undefined tangent values or sign changes. The Lean4 formalization captures this structure through explicit domain constraints followed by the optimization statement.\n\n**Now the Final Lean Translation is:**\ntheorem tanh (α β γ : ℝ) (h₀ : α ∈ Ioo 0 (π / 2)) (h₁ : β ∈ Ioo 0 (π / 2))\n    (h₂ : γ ∈ Ioo 0 (π / 2)) (h₃ : sin α + sin β + sin γ = 1) :\n    tan α ^ 2 + tan β ^ 2 + tan γ ^ 2 ≥ 3 / 8 := by sorry\nnow verify whether the Lean4 theorem statement accurately captures the mathematical content of the original natural language problem and its structured decomposition.\n## 1.

While the original problem asks to prove that x = 100/27 is \"the solution\" (implying uniqueness), the Lean4 formalization uses a biconditional (↔) which states logical equivalence between the equation and the value assignment.

Final Conclusion + Error Analysis\n\nThe Lean4 translation is mathematically stronger than what the original problem explicitly requests. The original problem statement \"prove that the solution is x = 100/27\" could be interpreted as simply asking to verify that this value satisfies the equation.

The function definition using fractional exponents properly represents the fourth and cube roots, and the `Tendsto` framework with appropriate neighborhood notation correctly formalizes the limit statement. The target value is accurately represented.\n\nHowever, there are some structural inefficiencies: the unnecessary separation of the numerator into a separate function `f` makes the formalization more complex than needed. A more direct approach would define the entire fraction as a single lambda expression. Additionally, the theorem name \"Tendsto\" is poorly chosen as it conflicts with the Lean4 function name.\n\nDespite these minor issues, the mathematical content is preserved and the formalization would prove the same mathematical statement as the original problem.\n\n### 4.

However, this formulation is unconventional for this type of problem and may not align with the expected proof structure.\n\nThe more natural formalization would typically separate the existence claim from the uniqueness claim, or use an existential quantifier with uniqueness. The current biconditional approach, while mathematically sound, treats the problem as a characterization theorem rather than a solution-finding problem.\n\n<error>The biconditional structure, while mathematically equivalent, doesn't match the conventional formalization pattern for \"find all solutions\" problems.</error>\n\n### 4.

Find all integer points (x,y) on the circle x² + y² = 50\n2. For each such point, the constraint ax + by = 1 defines a line in the (a,b)-plane\n3. Count how many distinct (a,b) pairs arise from this process\n4. The answer 72 suggests there are multiple integer points on the circle, each contributing to valid (a,b) pairs\n\n**Now the Final Lean Translation is:**\ntheorem num_pairs :\n    Set.ncard {(a, b) : ℝ × ℝ |\n      ∃ x y : ℤ, a * x + b * y = 1 ∧ x ^ 2 + y ^ 2 = 50} = 72 := by sorry\nnow verify whether the Lean4 theorem statement accurately captures the mathematical content of the original natural language problem and its structured decomposition.\n## 1. Overall Comparison\n\nThe Lean4 theorem captures the core mathematical content of the original problem. It correctly formalizes the system of equations, the constraint that solutions must be integers, and the counting objective. However, there is a subtle but significant issue with the domain specification that affects the mathematical interpretation.\n\n## 2. Condition-by-Condition Correspondence\n\n* **Condition 1**: $a, b \\in \\mathbb{R}$ → `{(a, b) : ℝ × ℝ | ...}` → **✓ Perfect match**\n  The parameters a and b are correctly declared as real numbers in the set comprehension.\n\n* **Condition 2**: System $\\begin{cases} ax + by = 1 \\\\ x^2 + y^2 = 50 \\end{cases}$ → `a * x + b * y = 1 ∧ x ^ 2 + y ^ 2 = 50` → **✓ Perfect match**\n  Both equations are accurately represented with proper conjunction, and the mathematical expressions are correctly translated to Lean4 syntax.\n\n* **Condition 3**: \"at least one solution $(x, y)$ where both $x$ and $y$ are integers\" → `∃ x y : ℤ, ...` → **⚠ Partial match with concern**\n  The existential quantification correctly captures \"at least one solution,\" and declaring `x y : ℤ` properly ensures both are integers. However, the original problem implicitly assumes we're looking for real number pairs $(a,b)$ that are well-defined (i.e., not both zero when the linear equation $ax + by = 1$ must have a solution). The Lean4 formalization doesn't exclude degenerate cases where $a = b = 0$, which would make the equation $0 \\cdot x + 0 \\cdot y = 1$ unsolvable.\n\n* **Condition 4**: \"ordered pairs $(a, b)$ of real numbers\" → `{(a, b) : ℝ × ℝ | ...}` → **✓ Perfect match**\n  The set notation correctly captures ordered pairs of real numbers.\n\n* **Conclusion**: \"The number of ordered pairs $(a, b)$ is exactly $72$\" → `Set.ncard {...} = 72` → **✓ Perfect match**\n  The cardinality function `Set.ncard` correctly formalizes counting the number of elements in the set.\n\n## 3. Final Conclusion + Error Analysis\n\nThe Lean4 translation is largely mathematically consistent with the original problem. The formalization correctly captures the system of equations, the integer constraint on solutions, and the counting objective. The use of set comprehension with `Set.ncard` appropriately formalizes the counting problem.\n\nHowever, there is a minor technical issue: the formalization includes degenerate cases where $a = b = 0$, making the linear equation $ax + by = 1$ unsolvable. While this doesn't affect the final count (since such cases contribute 0 to the set), it's mathematically more precise to exclude these cases. In practice, this distinction may not matter for the theorem's validity since the constraint $ax + by = 1$ must be satisfiable, implicitly excluding the degenerate case.\n\nThe translation successfully preserves the essential mathematical structure and logical relationships of the original problem.\n\n<error>The formalization includes degenerate cases where a = b = 0, making the linear equation ax + by = 1 unsolvable, though this doesn't affect the final count.</error>\n\n## 4.

The formalization correctly uses Lean4's infinite sum notation `∑'` and proper type annotations.\n\nThe translation demonstrates appropriate Lean4 practices by:\n- Using `∑'` for infinite series over natural numbers\n- Providing explicit type annotation `(-1 : ℝ)` to ensure real number arithmetic\n- Expressing convergence as equality between the infinite sum and π\n- Using natural number indexing starting from 0\n\nWhile the decomposed structure provides rich descriptive detail about the series properties, the Lean4 theorem captures all these properties implicitly through its concise mathematical formulation. The theorem statement is both necessary and sufficient to represent the original problem.\n\n## 4. Assessment Result\n\n<box>match</box>",

Overall Comparison\n\nThe Lean4 theorem captures the core mathematical relationships of the original problem but has a critical unit inconsistency. While it correctly models the distance-speed-time relationships and the relative timing differences, it mixes time units (hours for the main variables, minutes for the delays) without proper conversion, making the formalization mathematically incorrect.\n\n### 2. Condition-by-Condition Correspondence\n\n- **Condition 1**: \"Departs at exactly 8:00 A.M. every morning\" → No explicit representation in Lean4 → **⚠ Implicit but acceptable**\n  The departure time is implicitly handled through the variable `t` representing travel time to arrive on schedule.\n\n- **Condition 2**: \"At 40 mph, arrives three minutes late\" → `(h1 : d / 40 = t + 3 / 60)` → **✗ Unit inconsistency**\n  The equation correctly models that travel time at 40 mph equals scheduled time plus delay, but `3/60` represents 3/60 hours (3 minutes), while the context suggests `t` is in hours.

Final Conclusion + Error Analysis\n\nThe Lean4 translation correctly captures the mathematical structure and relationships of the original problem. The core insight—that we have two equations relating distance, speed, and time with small timing deviations, leading to a conclusion about the optimal speed—is properly formalized. The parameters are appropriately declared and constrained.\n\nHowever, there is a significant unit consistency issue: the expressions `3/60` represent 3 minutes converted to hours (0.05 hours), but this conversion should be made explicit or the variables should be clearly defined in consistent units. While `3/60` is mathematically correct (3 minutes = 3/60 hours = 0.05 hours), the mixing of implicit time units makes the formalization less clear and potentially confusing.\n\nThe logical structure is sound, and if the units are interpreted consistently (all times in hours), the mathematical relationships are correct and the conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n\n<error>The formalization has implicit unit conversion issues where 3/60 represents minutes converted to hours without explicit clarification of time units.</error>\n\n### 4.

The formalization converts degrees to radians using the factor π/180: 215° becomes `215 * π / 180` and 35° becomes `35 * π / 180`. The equality `cos (215 * π / 180) = -cos (35 * π / 180)` directly captures the mathematical relationship.\n\n**Problem 2: Even Function Property**\nThe natural language states \"sec(x) is an even function\" meaning sec(-x) = sec(x). In Lean4, this is captured using the predicate `Even` applied to the function `fun x => 1 / cos x`. The `Even` predicate in Lean4 automatically encodes the property that f(-x) = f(x) for all x in the domain, eliminating the need to explicitly handle domain restrictions since division by zero is handled appropriately in Lean4's real number system.\n\n**Problem 3: Odd Function Property**\nSimilarly, \"csc(x) is an odd function\" means csc(-x) = -csc(x). This is formalized using the `Odd` predicate applied to `fun x => 1 / sin x`. The `Odd` predicate encodes f(-x) = -f(x), and again domain issues are handled automatically.\n\n**Key Insight:** Lean4's function predicates `Even` and `Odd` elegantly capture the parity properties without explicitly managing domains, while the degree-to-radian conversion bridges the gap between practical angle measurement and mathematical formalization.\n\n**Now the Final Lean Translation is:**\ntheorem cos_215 : cos (215 * π / 180) = -cos (35 * π / 180) := by sorry\n\ntheorem sec_even : Even (fun x => 1 / cos x) := by sorry\n\ntheorem csc_odd : Odd (fun x => 1 / sin x) := by sorry\nnow verify whether the Lean4 theorem statement accurately captures the mathematical content of the original natural language problem and its structured decomposition.\n## 1.

The first theorem correctly converts degrees to radians, and the second and third theorems properly use Lean4's built-in `Even` and `Odd` predicates. However, there are issues with domain handling and the degree-to-radian conversion approach that affect the complete accuracy of the formalization.\n\n## 2.

The first theorem correctly handles the degree-to-radian conversion. The second and third theorems appropriately use Lean4's built-in `Even` and `Odd` predicates, which implicitly handle the domain restrictions and parity properties.\n\nHowever, there are minor issues: the domain restrictions for secant and cosecant functions are not explicitly stated in the Lean4 formalization, though this is somewhat acceptable since Lean4's type system and the `Even`/`Odd` predicates handle these constraints implicitly. The mathematical relationships and function definitions are accurately preserved.\n\nThe translation demonstrates good Lean4 practices by using appropriate built-in predicates and maintaining mathematical precision in the degree-to-radian conversion.\n\n## 4.

The goal is to prove that p = 38, which means we need to solve this system and show Patricia's amount is exactly 38.\n\n**Step 3: Lean4 Formalization Strategy**\nThe Lean4 theorem captures this perfectly as a pure algebraic statement:\n- Parameters: p r s : ℝ (using reals for dollar amounts)\n- Hypotheses: h₀, h₁, h₂ encode the three given conditions exactly as equations\n- Goal: p = 38 (the specific value Patricia has)\n\nThe proof strategy would involve substituting the first two equations into the third to eliminate r and s, yielding a single equation in p, then solving to get p = 38. This is a straightforward algebraic manipulation that Lean4 can verify step by step.\n\n**Now the Final Lean Translation is:**\ntheorem patricia (p r s : ℝ)\n    (h₀ : p = r + 12) (h₁ : p = s + 15) (h₂ : p + r + s = 87) :\n    p = 38 := by sorry\nnow verify whether the Lean4 theorem statement accurately captures the mathematical content of the original natural language problem and its structured decomposition.\n## 1.

Final Conclusion\n\nThe Lean4 translation is mathematically consistent and logically equivalent to the original problem. All three conditions are accurately captured with appropriate variable relationships, and the conclusion correctly states what needs to be proven. The formalization properly uses real numbers (ℝ) for the monetary amounts, which is appropriate since dollar amounts can be treated as real numbers in this mathematical context.\n\nThe translation demonstrates good Lean4 practices by:\n- Using clear variable names (p, r, s) corresponding to Patricia, Rhoda, and Sarah\n- Employing numbered hypotheses (h₀, h₁, h₂) for systematic organization\n- Directly expressing each relationship as an equality\n- Maintaining the algebraic structure that allows for straightforward solving\n\nThe system of equations formed by the hypotheses (p = r + 12, p = s + 15, p + r + s = 87) can indeed be solved to yield p = 38, making the theorem statement mathematically sound.\n\n## 4.

Condition-by-Condition Correspondence\n\n* **Condition 1**: $x \\geq 0$ → `x ≥ 0` (left side of conjunction) → **✓ Perfect match**\n  The nonnegativity constraint is correctly captured in the Lean4 formalization.\n\n* **Condition 2**: $\\frac{1}{2x - 3} = 2x + 3$ → `(1 / (2 * x - 3)) = (2 * x + 3)` → **✓ Perfect match**\n  The reciprocal equation is exactly preserved in Lean4 syntax.\n\n* **Condition 3**: $(2x - 3) \\neq 0$ (implicit constraint) → **Missing from explicit formalization** → **⚠ Implicit handling**\n  The Lean4 translation doesn't explicitly state this constraint, though it's implicitly required for the division to be well-defined. In Lean4's real number system, division by zero typically returns 0, so this constraint should ideally be explicit.\n\n* **Conclusion**: \"The only possible nonnegative value... is $x = \\frac{\\sqrt{10}}{2}$\" → `x ≥ 0 ∧ (1 / (2 * x - 3)) = (2 * x + 3) ↔ x = Real.sqrt 10 / 2` → **✓ Logically equivalent**\n  The biconditional correctly captures the uniqueness claim: the left side holds if and only if x equals the specific value.\n\n## 3. Final Conclusion\n\nThe Lean4 translation is largely mathematically consistent with the original problem. The biconditional structure effectively captures the uniqueness claim by stating that the conjunction of conditions (nonnegativity and the reciprocal equation) holds if and only if x equals the specified value. However, there is a minor issue with the implicit handling of the division-by-zero constraint. While Lean4's type system and real number implementation may handle this gracefully, the original problem explicitly mentions this constraint, and mathematical rigor would suggest including it explicitly in the formalization.\n\nThe formalization correctly:\n- Preserves the nonnegativity constraint\n- Captures the reciprocal equation exactly\n- Expresses uniqueness through the biconditional structure\n- Uses the correct Lean4 syntax for the square root expression\n\nThe main concern is the implicit treatment of the denominator nonzero constraint, though this may be acceptable depending on Lean4's handling of division by zero in the real number system.\n\n## 4.

This makes the theorem less direct and intuitive compared to the straightforward arithmetic problem. The semantic context (sandwiches, sodas, dollar amounts) is completely abstracted away, though this doesn't affect mathematical correctness.\n\nThe translation demonstrates valid Lean4 practices by using natural numbers for quantities and properly constraining the variables, but a more direct approach would better match the problem's simplicity.\n\n## 4.

The mathematical objects (function 1/x, positive infinity, limit value 0) are all correctly represented using appropriate Lean4 constructs. The `Tendsto` framework with `atTop` and `𝓝 0` is the standard and correct way to formalize limits in Lean4.\n\nHowever, there is a structural issue with the theorem naming. The theorem is named \"Tendsto\" which conflicts with the Lean4 function `Tendsto` being used in the statement itself. This creates a naming ambiguity that could cause compilation issues or confusion.\n\nThe formalization properly addresses the note in the decomposed structure by focusing specifically on positive infinity (using `atTop`), which is mathematically sound since the limit from positive infinity is well-defined and equals 0.\n\n<error>The theorem name \"Tendsto\" conflicts with the Lean4 function Tendsto used in the statement, creating a naming ambiguity.</error>\n\n## 4.

This translates to showing that the ratio of new area to original area equals 1.96 (since 100% + 96% = 196% of original).\n\n**Step 2: Mathematical Structure**\n- Original area: π * r²\n- New radius: 1.4 * r (40% increase means multiplying by 1.4)\n- New area: π * (1.4 * r)²\n- Area ratio: (New Area)/(Original Area) = (π * (1.4 * r)²)/(π * r²)\n\n**Step 3: Lean4 Formalization Mapping**\n- Parameter: `r : ℝ` represents the radius\n- Constraint: `hr : r = 50` captures the specific radius value\n- Target: The ratio `(π * (1.4 * r)^2) / (π * r^2) = 1.96` directly expresses that the new area is 196% of the original\n- Key insight: The π terms cancel out, so this becomes a pure algebraic statement about (1.4)² = 1.96\n\n**Step 4: Why This Formalization Works**\nInstead of explicitly calculating percentage increase, the theorem proves the equivalent statement that the area ratio equals 1.96, which immediately implies a 96% increase. The specific value r = 50 is maintained but will cancel out in the proof, showing this result holds for any radius.\n\n**Now the Final Lean Translation is:**\ntheorem prove (r : ℝ) (hr : r = 50) :\n    (π * (1.4 * r)^2) / (π * r^2) = 1.96 := by sorry\nnow verify whether the Lean4 theorem statement accurately captures the mathematical content of the original natural language problem and its structured decomposition.\n## 1.

It correctly formalizes the radius parameter and the area ratio calculation, but it doesn't explicitly represent all the given conditions as separate hypotheses. The conclusion correctly captures the relationship between new and original areas as a ratio of 1.96 (representing 196% of the original area).\n\n## 2.

Final Conclusion + Error Analysis\n\nThe Lean4 translation is mathematically consistent and logically equivalent to the original problem. The core mathematical relationship is correctly captured: the ratio of the new area (with radius increased by 40%) to the original area equals 1.96, which indeed represents a 96% increase. \n\nThe formalization uses the correct area formula for circles (π * r²) and properly computes the ratio by dividing the new area by the original area. The π terms cancel out in the division, leaving the essential relationship between the radius changes and area changes.\n\nWhile the translation doesn't explicitly separate all the intermediate steps (like defining the new radius as a separate variable), this is actually a more direct and efficient approach in formal mathematics. The essential mathematical content - that a 40% radius increase leads to a 96% area increase - is perfectly preserved.\n\nThe theorem correctly captures the quadratic relationship between radius and area changes: (1.4)² = 1.96, showing that a 40% radius increase results in a 96% area increase.\n\n## 4.

The key insight is that we need `n : ℕ` (natural numbers) rather than integers, and the exponent `2*n` ensures we're always dealing with even powers of odd numbers. The conclusion \"k^(2n) is of the form 8r + 1\" maps to the existential statement `∃ r, k^(2*n) = 8*r + 1`, where Lean4 automatically infers that r must be an integer.\n\n**Problem 2 - Cubic Remainders Modulo 7:**\nThe phrase \"when a³ is divided by 7, the possible remainders are 0, 1, or 6\" translates to modular arithmetic using Lean4's `ZMOD` notation.

A dime has a value of $0.10\n\nTo prove: The number of nickels is 30 and the number of dimes is 16.\n\n**Problem 2:**\n1. Jonathan and Tim are initially 1360 yards apart\n2.

In Lean4, we capture this by:\n- Using natural numbers `n d : ℕ` for coin counts (since you can't have fractional coins)\n- Converting the value constraint to cents to avoid decimals: $3.10 becomes 310 cents\n- The two conditions become: `n + d = 46` (total coins) and `5*n + 10*d = 310` (total value in cents)\n- The conclusion is a conjunction `n=30 ∧ d=16`\n\n**Problem 2 - Meeting Time:**\nThis is a classic \"meeting in the middle\" problem where combined speeds determine meeting time. The formalization:\n- Uses real number `t : ℝ` for time (allowing fractional minutes)\n- Adds positivity constraint `ht : t > 0` (time must be positive)\n- The key insight: distance covered by both runners equals total distance: `16*t + 18*t = 1360`\n- Conclusion is the simple equality `t = 40`\n\n**Problem 3 - Mystery Number:**\nThis translates a word problem into a linear equation. The formalization:\n- Uses integer `x : ℤ` since the answer is negative (and the problem suggests an integer context)\n- Directly translates \"three times x, increased by 100, equals 12 less than x\" into `3*x + 100 = x - 12`\n- The conclusion `x = -56` follows from solving this linear equation\n\nEach problem demonstrates how word problems become systems of equations, with Lean4 requiring explicit type choices and constraint formalization.\n\n**Now the Final Lean Translation is:**\ntheorem sum_nickels_dimes (n d : ℕ) (h₀ : n + d = 46) (h₁ : 5*n+10*d=310) :\n    n=30 ∧ d=16 := by sorry\n\ntheorem run_towards_eachother (t : ℝ) (ht : t > 0) (h : 16*t+18*t=1360) :\n    t=40 := by sorry\n\ntheorem mystery_number (x : ℤ) (h : 3*x+100=x-12) : x=-56 := by sorry\nnow verify whether the Lean4 theorem statement accurately captures the mathematical content of the original natural language problem and its structured decomposition.\n### 1. Overall Comparison\n\nThe Lean4 translation captures the mathematical essence of all three problems reasonably well. Each theorem correctly identifies the key variables, main constraints, and desired conclusions. However, there are some issues with completeness in capturing all the given conditions, particularly regarding explicit value representations and some implicit assumptions.\n\n### 2. Condition-by-Condition Correspondence\n\n**Problem 1 - Nickels and Dimes:**\n- **Condition 1**: Sam has nickels and dimes → `(n d : ℕ)` → **✓ Good match** - Natural numbers appropriately represent coin counts\n- **Condition 2**: Total coins = 46 → `(h₀ : n + d = 46)` → **✓ Perfect match**\n- **Condition 3**: Combined value = $3.10 → `(h₁ : 5*n+10*d=310)` → **✓ Good match** - Uses cents (310) instead of dollars, which is mathematically equivalent\n- **Conditions 4-5**: Nickel = $0.05, Dime = $0.10 → Implicitly encoded in the equation → **⚠ Acceptable** - Values are implicit in the coefficients\n- **Conclusion**: n=30 and d=16 → `n=30 ∧ d=16` → **✓ Perfect match**\n\n**Problem 2 - Running towards each other:**\n- **Condition 1**: 1360 yards apart → Implicit in equation `16*t+18*t=1360` → **✓ Good match**\n- **Condition 2**: Start simultaneously → Implicit in the mathematical model → **✓ Acceptable**\n- **Condition 3**: Jonathan's rate = 16 yards/min → Coefficient 16 in equation → **✓ Good match**\n- **Condition 4**: Tim's rate = 18 yards/min → Coefficient 18 in equation → **✓ Good match**\n- **Condition 5**: Constant speeds → Implicit in linear equation → **✓ Acceptable**\n- **Additional**: `(ht : t > 0)` → **✓ Good addition** - Ensures physical meaningfulness of time\n- **Conclusion**: Meeting time = 40 minutes → `t=40` → **✓ Perfect match**\n\n**Problem 3 - Mystery number:**\n- **Condition 1**: Mystery number exists → `(x : ℤ)` → **✓ Good match** - Integer type is appropriate\n- **Conditions 2-5**: Mathematical relationship → `(h : 3*x+100=x-12)` → **✓ Perfect match** - Correctly captures the equation\n- **Conclusion**: Mystery number = -56 → `x=-56` → **✓ Perfect match**\n\n### 3. Final Conclusion\n\nThe Lean4 translation is mathematically consistent and logically equivalent to the original problems. All three theorems correctly formalize the essential mathematical relationships and conclusions. The translations demonstrate good mathematical judgment by:\n\n- Using appropriate types (ℕ for coin counts, ℝ for time, ℤ for the mystery number)\n- Converting dollars to cents in Problem 1 to work with integers\n- Adding the positivity constraint for time in Problem 2\n- Correctly encoding the constraint equations\n\nWhile some conditions are implicit rather than explicit (such as coin values and constant speeds), this is acceptable in mathematical formalization as these are captured by the constraint equations themselves. The core mathematical content is preserved accurately across all three problems.\n\n### 4. Assessment Result\n\n<box>match</box>",

This is a characterization problem: we need to show that being a solution to the equation is equivalent to being the golden ratio φ = (1+√5)/2.\n\n**Step 2: Handling Domain Constraints**\nThe equation involves terms 1/x, √(x-1/x), and √(1-1/x), which require:\n- x ≠ 0 (to avoid division by zero)\n- x - 1/x ≥ 0 and 1 - 1/x ≥ 0 (for square roots to be real)\n\nRather than explicitly listing all domain conditions, the Lean formalization elegantly captures this by including x ≠ 0 in the equivalence statement. The other constraints are implicitly handled since if x satisfies the equation, the square root expressions must be well-defined.\n\n**Step 3: Translating \"Only Solution\" to Logical Equivalence**\nThe phrase \"the only real solution is φ\" means:\n- If x is a real solution, then x = φ\n- φ is indeed a solution\n\nThis bidirectional relationship is perfectly captured by the logical equivalence (↔) in Lean:\n`x ≠ 0 ∧ x = √(x - 1/x) + √(1 - 1/x) ↔ x = (1 + √5)/2`\n\n**Step 4: Lean4 Formalization Insights**\n- Uses `Real.sqrt` for the square root function in ℝ\n- Combines the non-zero constraint with the equation using conjunction (∧)\n- The equivalence automatically handles both directions: uniqueness and existence\n- The target value (1 + √5)/2 directly represents the golden ratio in Lean's real number system\n\n**Now the Final Lean Translation is:**\ntheorem Real.sqrt_eq (x : ℝ) :\n    x ≠ 0 ∧ x = Real.sqrt (x - 1 / x) + Real.sqrt (1 - 1 / x) ↔\n    x = (1 + Real.sqrt 5) / 2 := by sorry\nnow verify whether the Lean4 theorem statement accurately captures the mathematical content of the original natural language problem and its structured decomposition.\n### 1. Overall Comparison\n\nThe Lean4 theorem captures the core mathematical content of the original problem but has some structural differences. While it correctly identifies the unique solution and handles the non-zero constraint, it uses a biconditional (↔) structure rather than explicitly stating uniqueness. The domain constraints for the square roots are implicitly handled but not explicitly stated as separate conditions.\n\n### 2. Condition-by-Condition Correspondence\n\n- **Condition 1**: $x$ is a real number → `(x : ℝ)` → **✓ Perfect match**\n  The real number type declaration correctly captures this condition.\n\n- **Condition 2**: The equation $x = \\sqrt{x - \\frac{1}{x}} + \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{x}}$ → `x = Real.sqrt (x - 1 / x) + Real.sqrt (1 - 1 / x)` → **✓ Perfect match**\n  The equation is exactly preserved in Lean4 syntax with proper function notation.\n\n- **Condition 3**: Domain constraints ($x \\neq 0$, $x - \\frac{1}{x} \\geq 0$, $1 - \\frac{1}{x} \\geq 0$) → `x ≠ 0` (explicit) + implicit domain handling → **⚠ Partial match**\n  Only the non-zero constraint is explicitly stated. The non-negativity constraints for the square root arguments are implicitly handled by Lean's Real.sqrt function but not explicitly declared as hypotheses.\n\n- **Conclusion**: Exactly one real solution $x = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}$ → `x ≠ 0 ∧ x = Real.sqrt (x - 1 / x) + Real.sqrt (1 - 1 / x) ↔ x = (1 + Real.sqrt 5) / 2` → **⚠ Structural difference**\n  The biconditional structure implicitly captures uniqueness (since the right side has only one value), but doesn't explicitly state \"exactly one solution\" or \"unique solution\". The mathematical content is equivalent but the logical structure differs from a direct uniqueness statement.\n\n### 3. Final Conclusion + Error Analysis\n\nThe Lean4 translation is mathematically consistent with the original problem and captures the essential content correctly. The biconditional structure effectively encodes both the existence and uniqueness of the solution: the left-to-right direction shows that any solution to the constrained equation must be the golden ratio, while the right-to-left direction shows that the golden ratio is indeed a solution. \n\nHowever, there are some structural differences: the domain constraints for square root non-negativity are handled implicitly rather than explicitly stated, and the uniqueness claim is encoded through the biconditional rather than explicitly stated. These differences don't affect mathematical correctness but represent different approaches to formalization - the Lean version is more concise while the decomposed structure is more explicit about all conditions.\n\nThe translation successfully identifies the correct unique solution and properly handles the essential constraint (x ≠ 0), making it a valid formalization of the original problem.\n\n### 4.

The key insight in the formalization is reformulating the equation $LHS = RHS$ as finding zeros of the function $f(x) = LHS - RHS$, which is a standard and mathematically sound approach. The set equality `{x | f x = 0} = {0, 1, 2}` elegantly captures both parts of the proof requirement: that 0, 1, 2 are solutions (they belong to the left-hand set) and that these are the only solutions (the sets are equal, not just subset-related).\n\nThe formalization demonstrates good mathematical practice by:\n- Using function notation to make the equation manipulation explicit\n- Employing set-builder notation to precisely define the solution set\n- Structuring the conclusion as a set equality that captures both existence and uniqueness\n- Maintaining the real number domain throughout\n\n### 4.

Note that Lean uses explicit multiplication operators `*` and the associativity is handled by the ring structure.\n\n**Step 4: Mathematical Structure Insight**\nThe problem has a beautiful structure: we're given that sums of squares are squares (hypothesis), and need to prove that certain triple products are squares (conclusion). The finiteness of A suggests the proof might involve counting arguments or properties specific to finite rings, such as the fact that squaring is eventually periodic in finite rings.\n\n**Now the Final Lean Translation is:**\ntheorem FinRing {A : Type*} [Ring A] [Fintype A]\n    (h : ∀ a b : A, ∃ d : A, a ^ 2 + b ^ 2 = d ^ 2) :\n    ∀ a b c : A, ∃ d : A, 2 * a * b * c = d ^ 2 := by sorry\nnow verify whether the Lean4 theorem statement accurately captures the mathematical content of the original natural language problem and its structured decomposition.\n### 1. Overall Comparison\n\nThe Lean4 theorem captures the core mathematical structure of the original problem. It correctly formalizes the ring-theoretic setting, the finiteness condition, and the key hypothesis about sums of squares. The conclusion is also properly structured as an existential statement. However, there is a subtle but significant discrepancy in the associativity of the multiplication in the conclusion.\n\n### 2. Condition-by-Condition Correspondence\n\n- **Condition 1**: $A$ is a finite ring → `{A : Type*} [Ring A] [Fintype A]` → **✓ Perfect match**\n  The Lean4 formalization correctly captures both the ring structure through the `[Ring A]` typeclass and the finiteness through `[Fintype A]`.\n\n- **Condition 2**: For any $a, b \\in A$, there exists $d \\in A$ such that $a^2 + b^2 = d^2$ → `(h : ∀ a b : A, ∃ d : A, a ^ 2 + b ^ 2 = d ^ 2)` → **✓ Perfect match**\n  The universal quantification over elements $a, b$ and the existential quantification for $d$ are correctly captured, with the equation $a^2 + b^2 = d^2$ exactly preserved.\n\n- **Conclusion**: For any $a, b, c \\in A$, there exists $d \\in A$ such that $2abc = d^2$ → `∀ a b c : A, ∃ d : A, 2 * a * b * c = d ^ 2` → **✗ Mismatch**\n  While the logical structure (universal quantification over $a, b, c$ and existential quantification for $d$) is correct, there's a discrepancy in the expression. The original states $2abc = d^2$, but the Lean4 version uses `2 * a * b * c`, which due to operator precedence in Lean4 is parsed as `((2 * a) * b) * c`, whereas the mathematical expression $2abc$ would typically be interpreted as `2 * (a * b * c)`. In a ring, these are equivalent due to associativity, but the parsing differs from the natural mathematical reading.\n\n### 3. Final Conclusion + Error Analysis\n\nThe translation is mathematically consistent and logically equivalent to the original problem. All major components are correctly formalized: the finite ring structure, the hypothesis about sums of squares being squares, and the conclusion about products being squares. The Lean4 formalization properly uses universal and existential quantifiers in the appropriate places and maintains the algebraic relationships.\n\nThe only issue is a minor notational one regarding operator precedence in the expression `2 * a * b * c` versus the intended `2 * (a * b * c)`. However, since multiplication in rings is associative, these expressions are mathematically equivalent, so this does not affect the mathematical content or correctness of the formalization.\n\nThe translation demonstrates proper Lean4 practices by using appropriate typeclasses for rings and finite types, and structuring the theorem with clear hypotheses and conclusion.\n\n### 4.

Condition-by-Condition Correspondence\n\n* **Condition 1**: Equation $(2^{6x + 3})(4^{3x + 6}) = 8^{4x + 5}$ → `(2^(6*x+3)*(4^(3*x+6)) : ℝ) = 8^(4*x+5)` → **⚠ Mostly correct with minor concerns**\n  The equation structure is preserved, but there's an asymmetric type annotation where only the left side is explicitly cast to ℝ while the right side relies on implicit typing.\n\n* **Condition 2**: $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ → `{x : ℝ | ...}` → **✓ Perfect match**\n  The domain restriction to real numbers is correctly captured through the set comprehension syntax.\n\n* **Conclusion**: \"The number of real solutions is greater than 3\" → `Set.ncard {x : ℝ | ...} > 3` → **✓ Conceptually correct**\n  The conclusion properly uses set cardinality to count solutions and compares it with 3.\n\n## 3. Final Conclusion + Error Analysis\n\nThe Lean4 translation is mathematically consistent with the original problem and correctly captures the essential structure. The set comprehension properly defines the solution set, and `Set.ncard` appropriately counts the cardinality. The exponential equation is faithfully represented with correct operator precedence and parenthesization.\n\nThe main technical concern is the asymmetric type handling in the equation, where only the left side has an explicit type cast to ℝ. However, this is likely to work correctly in practice due to Lean4's type inference system, which should automatically infer that all exponential expressions should be treated as real numbers for consistency.\n\nThe formalization appropriately handles the infinite nature of the real number domain and uses the correct cardinality function for potentially infinite sets. The mathematical content, logical structure, and proof obligation are all accurately preserved.\n\n## 4. Assessment Result\n\n<box>match</box>",

The given formula `2 * π * r * (r + h)` equals `2 * π * r^2 + 2 * π * r * h` only when expanded, but the Lean4 version incorrectly shows `2 * π * r * (r + h)` which would be `2 * π * r^2 + 2 * π * r * h` when expanded.

We are specifically interested in prime numbers that have 7 as their units digit (i.e., numbers ending in 7)\n\nTo prove: The count of prime numbers less than 100 that have 7 as their units digit is exactly 6.\nnow begin translating\n**Step 1: Understanding the Mathematical Objects**\nThe problem asks to count prime numbers with specific properties, which translates to finding the cardinality of a well-defined set. We need to identify primes less than 100 that end in digit 7.\n\n**Step 2: Set Comprehension Translation**\nThe natural language \"prime numbers less than 100 that have 7 as their units digit\" maps directly to the set comprehension:\n`{n : ℕ | n.Prime ∧ n < 100 ∧ (n % 10) = 7}`\n\nThis captures three conditions:\n- `n.Prime`: the number must be prime\n- `n < 100`: the number must be less than 100\n- `(n % 10) = 7`: the units digit is 7 (modulo 10 gives the remainder when divided by 10)\n\n**Step 3: Cardinality and Counting**\n\"The number of... is 6\" translates to `Set.ncard ... = 6`, where `Set.ncard` computes the cardinality of a finite set.

This is a finite verification problem that can be solved computationally.\n\n**Now the Final Lean Translation is:**\ntheorem prove :\n    Set.ncard {n : ℕ | n.Prime ∧ n < 100 ∧ (n % 10) = 7} = 6 := by sorry\nnow verify whether the Lean4 theorem statement accurately captures the mathematical content of the original natural language problem and its structured decomposition.\n## 1. Overall Comparison\n\nThe Lean4 theorem accurately captures the essence of the original problem. It correctly formalizes the mathematical objects (prime numbers, natural numbers less than 100), maintains the constraint on the units digit being 7, and structures the conclusion as a counting statement. The formalization preserves the problem's core mathematical meaning of counting specific prime numbers.\n\n## 2. Condition-by-Condition Correspondence\n\n* **Condition 1**: We are considering prime numbers in base-ten representation → `n.Prime` → **✓ Perfect match**\n  The primality condition is correctly captured using Lean4's built-in primality predicate, which inherently works in base-ten representation for natural numbers.\n\n* **Condition 2**: Prime numbers less than 100 (range from 2 to 99) → `n < 100` → **✓ Perfect match**  \n  The upper bound constraint is correctly represented. Note that `n.Prime` already excludes 0 and 1, so the effective range is indeed primes from 2 to 99.\n\n* **Condition 3**: Prime numbers that have 7 as their units digit → `(n % 10) = 7` → **✓ Perfect match**\n  The units digit constraint is perfectly captured using modular arithmetic, where `n % 10` gives the last digit in base-ten representation.\n\n* **Conclusion**: The count is exactly 6 → `Set.ncard {n : ℕ | n.Prime ∧ n < 100 ∧ (n % 10) = 7} = 6` → **✓ Perfect match**\n  The conclusion is properly formalized using set cardinality (`Set.ncard`) applied to the set comprehension that captures exactly the primes satisfying all three conditions, equated to 6.\n\n## 3. Final Conclusion\n\nThe Lean4 translation is mathematically consistent and logically equivalent to the original problem. All conditions are accurately captured through appropriate predicates and constraints. The set comprehension `{n : ℕ | n.Prime ∧ n < 100 ∧ (n % 10) = 7}` precisely defines the collection of natural numbers that are prime, less than 100, and end in digit 7. The use of `Set.ncard` correctly formalizes the counting aspect of the problem.\n\nThe formalization demonstrates good Lean4 practices by:\n- Using the standard primality predicate `n.Prime`\n- Employing set comprehension with logical conjunction to combine all constraints\n- Using `Set.ncard` for counting finite sets\n- Working with natural numbers (`ℕ`) which is the appropriate type for this problem\n\nThe translation is mathematically rigorous and captures all the essential elements of the original counting problem without any loss of meaning or mathematical content.\n\n## 4.

The final sum of roots can be computed using Vieta's formulas or by solving explicitly and adding the roots.

The biconditional is mathematically stronger as it establishes both that x = 1/6 satisfies the equation AND that it's the unique solution.\n\n## 3. Final Conclusion + Error Analysis\n\nThe Lean4 translation is mathematically sound and actually provides a more complete characterization than the original problem statement. The biconditional formulation `logb 2 (3 * x) = logb 3 (2 * x) ↔ x = 1 / 6` proves both directions: (1) if the equation holds, then x = 1/6, and (2) if x = 1/6, then the equation holds. This is stronger than just proving x = 1/6 is \"the solution\" since it rigorously establishes uniqueness.\n\nHowever, there is a subtle logical structure difference. The original problem has an implicit existential claim (\"there exists a solution and it is x = 1/6\") while the Lean4 version makes a universal biconditional claim. Both are valid mathematical approaches, but they represent different proof strategies.\n\nThe domain restriction is properly handled, and all mathematical expressions are accurately translated. The formalization maintains mathematical rigor and is logically consistent with the original intent, even if it takes a more comprehensive approach.\n\n<error>The Lean4 formulation uses a biconditional (↔) structure instead of directly proving that x = 1/6 is the solution, changing the logical approach from existence proof to equivalence proof.</error>\n\n## 4.

      "think": "I will firstly decompose the problem into structured given conditions and conclusions to prove\nGiven the following conditions:\n\n1. $N$ is a positive integer\n2. $17$ and $30$ have the same remainder when divided by $N$\n3. We are looking for the largest such positive integer $N$\n\nTo prove: The largest positive integer $N$ satisfying the above conditions is $N = 13$.\nnow begin translating\n**Step 1: Understanding the Remainder Condition**\nWhen two numbers have the same remainder when divided by N, their difference is divisible by N. So \"17 and 30 have the same remainder when divided by N\" translates to \"N divides (30 - 17) = 13\", meaning N must be a divisor of 13.\n\n**Step 2: Identifying the Set of Valid N**\nThe condition \"17 % x = 30 % x\" captures the remainder equality directly in Lean4. Combined with \"0 < x\" (positive integer), we get the set {x | 0 < x ∧ 17 % x = 30 % x}, which represents all positive divisors of 13.\n\n**Step 3: Formalizing \"Largest\"**\nThe phrase \"largest positive integer N such that...\" maps to the concept IsGreatest in Lean4, which means:\n- 13 belongs to the set (so it satisfies the conditions)\n- 13 is an upper bound for the set (no element exceeds 13)\n\n**Step 4: Mathematical Insight**\nSince 13 is prime, its only positive divisors are 1 and 13. Both satisfy the remainder condition, but 13 is clearly the largest. The Lean4 formalization elegantly captures this by defining the constraint set and asserting that 13 is its greatest element.\n\n**Now the Final Lean Translation is:**\ntheorem gcd_17_30 : IsGreatest {x | 0 < x ∧ 17 % x = 30 % x} 13 := by sorry\nnow verify whether the Lean4 theorem statement accurately captures the mathematical content of the original natural language problem and its structured decomposition.\n## 1. Overall Comparison\n\nThe Lean4 theorem captures the core mathematical content of the original problem but uses a more sophisticated formalization approach. It correctly identifies the problem as finding the greatest element in a specific set, and properly formalizes the remainder condition. The mathematical essence and logical structure are preserved, though the formalization is more abstract than a direct translation might be.\n\n## 2. Condition-by-Condition Correspondence\n\n* **Condition 1**: $N$ is a positive integer → `{x | 0 < x ∧ ...}` → **✓ Perfect match**\n  The positivity constraint is correctly captured through the condition `0 < x` in the set comprehension.\n\n* **Condition 2**: $17$ and $30$ have the same remainder when divided by $N$ → `17 % x = 30 % x` → **✓ Perfect match**\n  The remainder condition is exactly preserved using Lean4's modulo operator `%`.\n\n* **Condition 3**: We are looking for the largest such positive integer $N$ → `IsGreatest {...} 13` → **✓ Perfect match**\n  The \"largest\" requirement is correctly formalized using Lean4's `IsGreatest` predicate, which captures both that 13 satisfies the conditions and that no larger element exists in the set.\n\n* **Conclusion**: The largest positive integer $N$ satisfying the conditions is $N = 13$ → `IsGreatest {x | 0 < x ∧ 17 % x = 30 % x} 13` → **✓ Perfect match**\n  The conclusion is properly formalized as stating that 13 is the greatest element in the set of positive integers where 17 and 30 have the same remainder.\n\n## 3. Final Conclusion\n\nThe Lean4 translation is mathematically consistent and logically equivalent to the original problem. The formalization elegantly captures all the essential components:\n\n- The set comprehension `{x | 0 < x ∧ 17 % x = 30 % x}` precisely defines the collection of all positive integers satisfying the remainder condition\n- The `IsGreatest` predicate correctly formalizes what it means to be the \"largest\" such integer\n- The specific value 13 is properly positioned as the claimed greatest element\n\nThe translation demonstrates sophisticated mathematical understanding by recognizing that this is fundamentally a problem about finding the maximum element in a well-defined set. The `IsGreatest` predicate encapsulates both the membership requirement (that 13 must satisfy the conditions) and the maximality requirement (that no larger element exists), which is exactly what the original problem asks to prove.\n\nThe formalization is mathematically rigorous and uses appropriate Lean4 constructs for set theory and order relationships.\n\n## 4.

Condition-by-Condition Correspondence\n\n* **Condition 1**: \"limit as $x$ approaches $1$\" → `Tendsto f (𝓝[≠] 1) (𝓝 (-2))` → **⚠ Potential issue**\n  The Lean4 uses punctured neighborhood `𝓝[≠] 1` which excludes the point $x = 1$. While this is mathematically reasonable since we're taking a limit, the standard limit notation doesn't explicitly exclude the point, and this choice should be justified by the function's domain.\n\n* **Condition 2**: $g(x) = \\frac{x^x - x}{\\ln x - x + 1}$ → `f = λ x => (x ^ x - x) / (log x - x + 1)` → **✓ Nearly perfect match**\n  The function definition is correctly captured in Lean4 syntax.

The function definition is accurate, and the limit conclusion is properly formalized using the appropriate Lean4 constructs. \n\nHowever, there are some concerns:\n1. The use of punctured neighborhood `𝓝[≠] 1` is technically correct but may be unnecessarily restrictive - standard limits don't require explicit exclusion of the limit point unless there are domain issues.\n2.

The function domain considerations (where $x^x$ and $\\ln x$ are defined) are not explicitly addressed.\n\nDespite these minor issues, the core mathematical relationship is correctly captured, and the formalization would be suitable for proving the intended limit theorem.\n\n## 4.

Overall Comparison\n\nThe Lean4 theorem captures the core mathematical relationship of the original problem but has a structural mismatch.

Final Conclusion + Error Analysis\n\nThe Lean4 translation is mathematically sound and captures all the essential mathematical content of the original problem. The constraint n ≥ 3 is properly included, the diagonal formula is correctly represented, and the equation setup is accurate. However, there is a subtle logical structural difference: the original problem asks to prove that n=5 is the unique solution to the equation, while the Lean4 version formulates this as a bidirectional equivalence statement.\n\nThis difference is more stylistic than substantive, as proving the equivalence `(n * (n - 3)) / 2 = n ↔ n = 5` under the constraint `n ≥ 3` effectively demonstrates the same mathematical fact - that n=5 is the unique solution. The bidirectional approach is actually more comprehensive as it proves both directions: if the equation holds then n=5, and if n=5 then the equation holds.\n\nThe formalization maintains mathematical rigor and would lead to the same proof techniques and conclusion as the original problem statement.\n\n### 4.

This is because any common divisor of x and y must also divide any linear combination of x and y.\n\n**Step 2: Capturing Given Conditions in Lean4**\n- The integer constraint is captured by the type annotation `(x y : ℤ)`\n- The linear equation constraint becomes the hypothesis `(h : 3 * x - 2 * y = 1)`\n- Note that Lean4 uses `*` for multiplication and requires explicit parentheses for precedence\n\n**Step 3: Formalizing the Conclusion**\n- The conclusion `gcd(x,y) = 1` maps directly to `Int.gcd x y = 1`\n- Lean4's `Int.gcd` function handles the greatest common divisor for integers\n- The equality `= 1` represents the coprimality condition\n\n**Step 4: Mathematical Insight**\nThe key insight is that if d divides both x and y, then d must also divide 3x - 2y = 1, which means d = ±1. Since gcd is always positive, we get gcd(x,y) = 1. The Lean4 formalization captures this reasoning structure through the direct implication from the linear constraint to the gcd conclusion.\n\n**Now the Final Lean Translation is:**\ntheorem gcdxy (x y : ℤ) (h : 3 * x - 2 * y = 1) :\n    Int.gcd x y = 1 := by sorry\nnow verify whether the Lean4 theorem statement accurately captures the mathematical content of the original natural language problem and its structured decomposition.\n### 1.

Condition-by-Condition Correspondence\n\n* **Condition 1**: Working with logarithmic expressions → `logb` and `log` functions in Lean4 → **✓ Conceptually correct**\n  The Lean4 translation uses appropriate logarithmic functions, though with different notation conventions.\n\n* **Condition 2**: $\\log_3 81$ → `logb 3 81` → **✓ Perfect match**\n  The logarithm base 3 of 81 is correctly represented using Lean4's `logb` function with base 3.\n\n* **Condition 3**: $\\ln e^{-7}$ → `log (exp (-7))` → **✓ Perfect match**\n  The natural logarithm of $e^{-7}$ is correctly represented using Lean4's `log` function (which represents natural logarithm) applied to `exp (-7)`.\n\n* **Condition 4**: Evaluate $\\log_3 81 - \\ln e^{-7}$ → `logb 3 81 - log (exp (-7))` → **✓ Perfect match**\n  The difference operation is correctly preserved in the Lean4 formalization.\n\n* **Conclusion**: $\\log_3 81 - \\ln e^{-7} = 11$ → `logb 3 81 - log (exp (-7)) = 11` → **✓ Perfect match**\n  The equality statement is correctly formalized with the claimed result of 11.\n\n## 3.

The mathematical content is fully preserved, and the statement can be proven by evaluating both logarithmic expressions: $\\log_3 81 = \\log_3 3^4 = 4$ and $\\ln e^{-7} = -7$, giving $4 - (-7) = 11$.\n\n## 4.

This involves:\n- A function that's undefined at $x = 0$ (due to $\\frac{0}{0}$ form)\n- Approaching $0$ from both sides, excluding the point itself\n- The target limit value $\\ln 8$\n\n**Step 2: Handling the Domain Issue**\nSince $\\frac{8^{\\sin x} - 1}{\\sin x}$ is undefined at $x = 0$, we need to consider the limit in a punctured neighborhood. In Lean4, this is captured by `𝓝[≠] 0`, which represents the neighborhood filter of $0$ excluding $0$ itself.\n\n**Step 3: Lean4 Translation Components**\n- **Function definition**: `f = λ x => (8 ^ sin x - 1) / sin x` captures the mathematical expression\n- **Limit notation**: `Tendsto f (𝓝[≠] 0) (𝓝 (log 8))` formalizes $\\lim_{x \\to 0} f(x) = \\ln 8$\n- **Logarithm**: Lean4 uses `log` for natural logarithm (ln)\n- **Domain restriction**: The `𝓝[≠] 0` automatically handles the requirement that $x \\neq 0$\n\n**Step 4: Mathematical Insight**\nThis is a classic limit of the form $\\lim_{u \\to 0} \\frac{a^u - 1}{u} = \\ln a$ where $u = \\sin x \\to 0$ as $x \\to 0$.

The theorem correctly identifies the function, the limit point (0), and the target value (ln 8). However, there are concerns about the neighborhood specification and the handling of the domain restriction where the function is undefined.\n\n## 2. Condition-by-Condition Correspondence\n\n* **Condition 1**: \"We are considering the limit as $x$ approaches $0$\" → `Tendsto f (𝓝[≠] 0) (𝓝 (log 8))` → **✓ Mostly correct**\n  The limit as x approaches 0 is correctly captured using `Tendsto` with neighborhood `𝓝[≠] 0`, though the punctured neighborhood notation could be more explicit.\n\n* **Condition 2**: \"The function in question is $\\frac{8^{\\sin x} - 1}{\\sin x}$\" → `(hf : f = λ x => (8 ^ sin x - 1) / sin x)` → **✓ Perfect match**\n  The function definition is exactly preserved in Lean4 syntax, with proper translation of exponential, sine, subtraction, and division operations.\n\n* **Condition 3**: \"We assume $x \\neq 0$ in a neighborhood of $0$ (so that the expression is well-defined)\" → `𝓝[≠] 0` → **⚠ Partially addressed**\n  The punctured neighborhood `𝓝[≠] 0` excludes the point 0, which addresses part of the concern. However, the function is actually undefined when $\\sin x = 0$, which occurs at more points than just $x = 0$ (e.g., $x = \\pi, 2\\pi$, etc.). The formalization only excludes $x = 0$ but doesn't fully capture that we need $\\sin x \\neq 0$ in the neighborhood.\n\n* **Conclusion**: \"$\\lim_{x \\to 0} \\frac{8^{\\sin x} - 1}{\\sin x} = \\ln 8$\" → `Tendsto f (𝓝[≠] 0) (𝓝 (log 8))` → **✓ Perfect match**\n  The limit statement is correctly formalized using Lean4's `Tendsto` with appropriate neighborhoods, and `log 8` correctly represents $\\ln 8$.\n\n## 3. Final Conclusion + Error Analysis\n\nThe Lean4 translation is largely consistent with the original problem and captures the essential mathematical content accurately. The function definition, limit point, and target value are all correctly formalized. The use of `Tendsto` with punctured neighborhood `𝓝[≠] 0` appropriately handles the fact that we're taking a limit as x approaches 0 without requiring the function to be defined at 0.\n\nHowever, there is a subtle issue: while the formalization excludes $x = 0$, it doesn't explicitly address that the function is undefined whenever $\\sin x = 0$. In practice, this is usually handled implicitly in Lean4's real analysis library, and for limits approaching 0, this distinction doesn't affect the validity since $\\sin x \\neq 0$ in a sufficiently small punctured neighborhood of 0.

For triangle angles, the correct constraint should be $A, B, C \\in (0, \\pi)$ individually, but the combination with $A + B + C = \\pi$ means each angle is actually in $(0, \\pi)$ with the additional constraint that no single angle can equal $\\pi$.\n\n* **Conclusion (i)**: $\\sin A + \\sin B + \\sin C \\leq \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ → `sin A + sin B + sin C ≤ 3 * sqrt 3 / 2` → **✓ Perfect match**\n\n* **Conclusion (ii)**: $\\csc A + \\csc B + \\csc C \\geq 2\\sqrt{3}$ → `1 / sin A + 1 / sin B + 1 / sin C ≥ 2 * sqrt 3` → **✓ Mathematically equivalent**\n  The cosecant function is correctly represented as the reciprocal of sine.\n\n* **Conclusion (iii)**: $(\\csc A)(\\csc B)(\\csc C) \\geq \\frac{8\\sqrt{3}}{9}$ → `1 / sin A * 1 / sin B * 1 / sin C ≥ 8 * sqrt 3 / 9` → **✓ Mathematically equivalent**\n  The product of cosecants is correctly represented as the product of reciprocals of sines.\n\n## 3. Final Conclusion\n\nThe Lean4 translation is largely mathematically consistent and captures the core inequalities correctly. The main issue is with the domain specification: using `Ioo 0 π` (open interval) for each angle while requiring `A + B + C = π` creates a subtle inconsistency. In a proper triangle, angles are in $(0, \\pi)$ individually, but the constraint $A + B + C = \\pi$ ensures they cannot all approach their bounds simultaneously. The formalization should work in practice since the sine function is well-defined and positive on $(0, \\pi)$, making the cosecant expressions meaningful. The three inequalities are accurately translated with correct mathematical expressions and inequality directions.\n\n<error>Domain specification uses open intervals Ioo 0 π for each angle, which combined with A + B + C = π creates a technical inconsistency in the constraint system.</error>\n\n## 4.

This naturally maps to Lean's `IsLeast` predicate.\n\n**Step 2: Identifying the Constraint Set**\nThe conditions define a set of natural numbers:\n- `n > 100`: strictly greater than 100\n- `n % 6 = 1`: remainder 1 when divided by 6\n- `n % 7 = 1`: remainder 1 when divided by 7  \n- `n % 8 = 1`: remainder 1 when divided by 8\n\nThese are combined with logical AND (`∧`) to form the set comprehension `{n | n > 100 ∧ n % 6 = 1 ∧ n % 7 = 1 ∧ n % 8 = 1}`.\n\n**Step 3: Mathematical Insight**\nThe remainder conditions `n ≡ 1 (mod 6)`, `n ≡ 1 (mod 7)`, `n ≡ 1 (mod 8)` mean `n - 1` is divisible by 6, 7, and 8. Since we need the least such `n`, we need `n - 1 = \\text{lcm}(6,7,8) \\cdot k` for some positive integer `k`. This gives us `n = \\text{lcm}(6,7,8) \\cdot k + 1 = 168k + 1`.\n\n**Step 4: Lean4 Formalization**\n`IsLeast S a` captures both requirements:\n- `a ∈ S`: 169 satisfies all the conditions\n- `∀ b ∈ S, a ≤ b`: 169 is minimal among all such numbers\n\nThe theorem directly states that 169 is the least element of the constraint set, which perfectly captures the original problem's requirement.\n\n**Now the Final Lean Translation is:**\ntheorem min_marbles :\n    IsLeast {n | n > 100 ∧ n % 6 = 1 ∧ n % 7 = 1 ∧ n % 8 = 1} 169 := by sorry\nnow verify whether the Lean4 theorem statement accurately captures the mathematical content of the original natural language problem and its structured decomposition.\n## 1. Overall Comparison\n\nThe Lean4 theorem accurately captures the essence of the original problem. It correctly formalizes the mathematical constraints (number greater than 100 with specific remainder conditions) and uses the appropriate mathematical structure (`IsLeast`) to express finding the minimum element in a constrained set. The formalization preserves the problem's core mathematical meaning of finding the least number satisfying multiple modular arithmetic conditions.\n\n## 2. Condition-by-Condition Correspondence\n\n* **Condition 1**: \"The box contains marbles, and we need to find the least number of marbles\" → `IsLeast {n | ...} 169` → **✓ Perfect match**\n  The `IsLeast` predicate correctly captures the requirement to find the minimum element in the constrained set.\n\n* **Condition 2**: \"The number of marbles is more than 100\" → `n > 100` → **✓ Perfect match**\n  The strict inequality constraint is exactly preserved in the set definition.\n\n* **Condition 3**: \"When the number of marbles is divided by 6, it leaves a remainder of 1\" → `n % 6 = 1` → **✓ Perfect match**\n  The modular arithmetic condition is correctly expressed using Lean4's modulo operator.\n\n* **Condition 4**: \"When the number of marbles is divided by 7, it leaves a remainder of 1\" → `n % 7 = 1` → **✓ Perfect match**\n  The modular arithmetic condition is correctly expressed.\n\n* **Condition 5**: \"When the number of marbles is divided by 8, it leaves a remainder of 1\" → `n % 8 = 1` → **✓ Perfect match**\n  The modular arithmetic condition is correctly expressed.\n\n* **Conclusion**: \"The least number of marbles satisfying all these conditions is 169\" → `IsLeast {n | n > 100 ∧ n % 6 = 1 ∧ n % 7 = 1 ∧ n % 8 = 1} 169` → **✓ Perfect match**\n  The conclusion is properly formalized using `IsLeast`, which asserts both that 169 belongs to the set and that it is the minimum element of the set.\n\n## 3. Final Conclusion\n\nThe Lean4 translation is mathematically consistent and logically equivalent to the original problem. All conditions are accurately captured through appropriate use of inequalities and modular arithmetic. The conclusion correctly uses `IsLeast` to formalize what it means for 169 to be the least number satisfying all constraints.\n\nThe formalization demonstrates good Lean4 practices by:\n- Using set-builder notation to clearly define the constraint set\n- Employing `IsLeast` which properly captures both membership and minimality\n- Correctly translating all modular arithmetic conditions\n- Maintaining the strict inequality for the lower bound\n\nThe translation preserves the mathematical structure where we seek the minimum element of the set {n ∈ ℕ | n > 100 ∧ n ≡ 1 (mod 6) ∧ n ≡ 1 (mod 7) ∧ n ≡ 1 (mod 8)}, which is exactly what the original problem asks for.\n\n## 4.

Final Conclusion\n\nThe Lean4 translation is mathematically consistent and accurately captures the essential content of the original limit problem. The function definition properly represents the normalized sum of sine functions, the summation bounds correctly correspond to the original indexing, and the limit structure is appropriately formalized using Lean4's topology library.\n\nThe minor concern about the domain (ℕ vs positive integers) is not practically significant since:\n1. The limit behavior is determined by large values of n\n2. The case n = 0 would make `Finset.Icc 1 (n-1) = Finset.Icc 1 (-1) = ∅`, giving f(0) = 0, which doesn't affect the limit\n3. For n = 1, we get an empty sum, so f(1) = 0, which also doesn't affect the asymptotic behavior\n\nThe translation demonstrates proper use of Lean4 mathematical structures:\n- Appropriate use of `Tendsto` for limit statements\n- Correct application of `Finset.Icc` for finite summation\n- Proper formalization of the neighborhood topology with `𝓝`\n- Accurate representation of the mathematical expressions\n\n## 4.

While it abstracts away the contextual details about car lot inventory and model years, it correctly captures the essential mathematical relationship: three quantities that sum to 33,000, where two are known (900 and 2,000) and one must be determined (30,100).\n\nThe formalization properly:\n- Uses natural numbers (ℕ) which is appropriate for counting cars\n- Structures the constraint as a hypothesis (h₀) representing the total inventory equation\n- Directly states the conclusion as an equality to be proven\n- Maintains the exact numerical values from the original problem\n\nThe translation demonstrates a clean, minimal approach that focuses on the mathematical core while omitting contextual details that don't affect the logical structure. This is appropriate for formal verification where the proof goal is purely arithmetical.\n\n## 4. Assessment Result\n\n<box>match</box>",

The inequality `sin x + cos x ≤ sqrt 2` is precisely formalized with correct Lean4 mathematical notation.\n\nThe formalization demonstrates proper Lean4 practices by:\n- Using the real number type `ℝ` for the variable `x`\n- Employing `Ioo` to represent the open interval, correctly excluding the endpoints 0 and π/2\n- Using standard Lean4 mathematical functions `sin`, `cos`, and `sqrt`\n- Structuring the theorem with a hypothesis `hx` that constrains the domain, making the universal quantification implicit in the theorem statement\n\nThe translation maintains the mathematical rigor of the original problem while using idiomatic Lean4 syntax and conventions.\n\n## 4.

The Lean4 version treats f as defined everywhere but only considers its behavior on the restricted domain through the image set construction. This is mathematically valid but represents a slightly different formalization approach than might be expected.\n\nThe mathematical expressions for the maximum and minimum values are correctly translated, preserving the exact numerical relationships from the original problem.\n\n### 4.

The arithmetic mean sequence $\\alpha_n$ is similarly represented as `α : ℕ → ℝ`.\n\n**Step 2: Arithmetic Mean Definition**\nThe definition $\\alpha_n = \\frac{a_1 + \\cdots + a_n}{n}$ translates to `h₁ : ∀ n, α n = (∑ i in Finset.Icc 1 n, a i) / n`.

The main components - positive sequence, arithmetic mean definition, and the inequality statement - are all properly formalized. The use of `Finset.Icc 1 N` correctly represents the summation from 1 to N as intended in the original problem.\n\nThe potential issue with n = 0 in the arithmetic mean definition is not practically problematic since the conclusion only uses the range [1,N] where N is a natural number, so α n is only evaluated for n ≥ 1. The indexing difference between Lean4's ℕ (starting from 0) and the mathematical convention (starting from 1) is handled appropriately by using `Finset.Icc 1 n` in the definitions.\n\nThe formalization demonstrates good Lean4 practices by:\n- Using appropriate type declarations for sequences as functions ℕ → ℝ\n- Employing `Finset.Icc` for finite interval summation\n- Structuring hypotheses clearly with positivity and definitional constraints\n- Using universal quantification for the main theorem statement\n\n## 4.

This is a constrained optimization problem where we need to find the supremum of the objective function over the feasible region.\n\n**Step 2: Translating to Set-Theoretic Language**\nIn Lean4, this constrained optimization is naturally expressed using sets:\n- The feasible set: `{z : ℝ | ∃ x y, z = cos x + cos y ∧ y - x = π / 4}`\n- This set contains all possible values of $\\cos x + \\cos y$ when the constraint is satisfied\n- The constraint $y - x = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$ is captured as a conjunction condition\n\n**Step 3: Formalizing \"Maximum Value\"**\nThe concept of \"maximum value\" is formalized using `IsGreatest`:\n- `IsGreatest S M` means $M$ is the greatest element of set $S$\n- This implies both: $M \\in S$ (the maximum is achieved) and $\\forall z \\in S, z \\leq M$ (upper bound property)\n- This captures both existence and optimality in one concept\n\n**Step 4: Key Mathematical Insight**\nThe constraint $y - x = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$ allows substitution $y = x + \\frac{\\pi}{4}$, reducing the problem to maximizing $\\cos x + \\cos(x + \\frac{\\pi}{4})$ over all real $x$. The Lean formalization elegantly avoids this reduction by working directly with the constraint set, making the structure more transparent and closer to the original problem statement.\n\n**Now the Final Lean Translation is:**\ntheorem max_value :\n  IsGreatest {z : ℝ | ∃ x y, z = cos x + cos y ∧ y - x = π / 4} (Real.sqrt (2 + Real.sqrt 2)) := by sorry\nnow verify whether the Lean4 theorem statement accurately captures the mathematical content of the original natural language problem and its structured decomposition.\n## 1.

While mathematically equivalent, this approach differs structurally from the typical optimization problem formalization pattern.\n\n## 2.

Final Conclusion + Error Analysis\n\nThe Lean4 translation is mathematically consistent and logically equivalent to the original problem. The formalization correctly captures all constraints and the objective function. However, it uses a set-theoretic approach with `IsGreatest` rather than the more standard optimization formalization pattern that would explicitly declare parameters and use existence/universality statements for the maximum property.\n\nThe `IsGreatest` predicate correctly encodes both required properties: (1) the value $\\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2}}$ is achievable (belongs to the set), and (2) it's an upper bound for all values in the feasible set. This is a valid and rigorous way to formalize maximum value problems in Lean4, though it may be less intuitive for those expecting a more direct translation of the optimization structure.\n\nThe mathematical content, constraint relationships, and target value are all accurately preserved.

Overall Comparison\n\nThe Lean4 theorem captures the core mathematical content of the original trigonometric identity problem. It correctly formalizes the parameters p and q with their non-zero constraints, and structures the conclusion as a universal quantification over all real x values. However, there are some stylistic and structural differences in how the left-hand side expression is represented.\n\n## 2. Condition-by-Condition Correspondence\n\n* **Condition 1**: $p \\neq 0$ → `(hp : p ≠ 0)` → **✓ Perfect match**\n  The non-zero constraint on parameter p is correctly captured.\n\n* **Condition 2**: $q \\neq 0$ → `(hq : q ≠ 0)` → **✓ Perfect match**  \n  The non-zero constraint on parameter q is correctly captured.\n\n* **Condition 3**: Left-hand side $p\\sin{x} + q\\cos{x}$ → `(f : ℝ → ℝ) (hf : f = λ x => p * sin x + q * cos x)` and `f x` in conclusion → **✓ Functionally equivalent**\n  The left-hand side expression is correctly captured, though indirectly through function f. The mathematical content is preserved.\n\n* **Condition 4**: Right-hand side $\\sqrt{p^2 + q^2} \\sin{\\left(x + \\tan^{-1}{\\frac{q}{p}}\\right)}$ → `sqrt (p ^ 2 + q ^ 2) * sin (x + arctan (q / p))` → **✓ Perfect match**\n  The right-hand side expression is exactly preserved in Lean4 syntax, with `arctan` being the standard Lean4 notation for $\\tan^{-1}$.\n\n* **Conclusion**: Identity holds for all x → `∀ x, f x = sqrt (p ^ 2 + q ^ 2) * sin (x + arctan (q / p))` → **✓ Perfect match**\n  The universal quantification correctly captures that the identity should hold for all real values of x where both sides are defined.\n\n## 3. Final Conclusion\n\nThe Lean4 translation is mathematically consistent and logically equivalent to the original problem. All conditions are accurately captured, including the non-zero constraints on both parameters. The trigonometric identity is properly formalized with the correct mathematical expressions on both sides.\n\nThe translation demonstrates appropriate Lean4 practices by:\n- Using proper type declarations for real numbers\n- Correctly representing the non-zero constraints\n- Using universal quantification to express the identity\n- Employing standard Lean4 mathematical notation (sqrt, sin, arctan)\n\nThe only stylistic difference is the introduction of function f to represent the left-hand side, which is a valid and clean approach in Lean4, though the expression could have been written directly in the conclusion. This does not affect the mathematical equivalence.\n\nThe formalization correctly handles the domain considerations implicitly - since both p and q are non-zero, the expression arctan(q/p) is well-defined, and both trigonometric functions are defined for all real x.\n\n## 4.

However, there is a technical issue with the integration bounds: using `Set.Icc 0 x` creates ambiguity when x < 0, as it represents [min(0,x), max(0,x)] rather than consistently integrating from 0 to x. For the limit as x → ∞, this doesn't affect the ultimate result since we're only concerned with large positive x, but it makes the function definition incomplete for the full real domain.\n\n<error>The integration bounds using Set.Icc 0 x are problematic for negative x values, creating domain ambiguity in the function definition.</error>\n\n## 4.

In Lean4, this is elegantly captured using:\n- `∑ i ∈ Finset.range (n + 1), a^i * b^(n - i)`\n- This represents the sum from i=0 to n of terms a^i * b^(n-i), which gives exactly a^n*b^0 + a^(n-1)*b^1 + ... + a^0*b^n\n\n**Step 3: Structure of the Inequality**\nThe inequality has a symmetric cyclic structure with three fractions on the left side and a simple expression on the right.

We have the equation $\\frac{x}{5} + \\frac{y}{3} = 1$ (given in intercept form)\n2. We need to transform this equation into slope-intercept form $y = mx + b$\n3.

This means showing that any point (x,y) satisfying one equation also satisfies the other, and vice versa.\n\n**Step 2: Identifying the Lean4 Structure**\n- **Variables**: `x y : ℝ` represents arbitrary real number coordinates\n- **Universal quantification**: `∀ (x y : ℝ)` means this equivalence holds for all real number pairs\n- **Biconditional**: The `↔` symbol captures \"algebraically equivalent\" - it means both directions of implication hold\n\n**Step 3: Mapping Problem to Formalization**\n- **Left side**: `x / 5 + y / 3 = 1` directly translates the intercept form\n- **Right side**: `y = -3 / 5 * x + 3` represents the slope-intercept form\n- **Key insight**: The biconditional `↔` formalizes \"can be transformed into\" by asserting logical equivalence\n\n**Step 4: Mathematical Structure**\nThe proof would involve algebraic manipulation: isolating y from the intercept form by subtracting x/5 from both sides, then multiplying by 3. The Lean4 formalization captures this as a logical equivalence that must hold for all real coordinate pairs, making it a universal statement about the relationship between these two equation forms.\n\n**Now the Final Lean Translation is:**\ntheorem x_y : ∀ (x y : ℝ), x / 5 + y / 3 = 1 ↔ y = -3 / 5 * x + 3 := by sorry\nnow verify whether the Lean4 theorem statement accurately captures the mathematical content of the original natural language problem and its structured decomposition.\n## 1. Overall Comparison\n\nThe Lean4 theorem captures the core mathematical content of the original problem, which is to prove the algebraic equivalence between two forms of the same linear equation. However, there is a critical numerical error in the Lean4 translation that makes it mathematically incorrect.\n\n## 2. Condition-by-Condition Correspondence\n\n* **Condition 1**: Original equation $\\frac{x}{5} + \\frac{y}{3} = 1$ → `x / 5 + y / 3 = 1` → **✓ Perfect match**\n  The intercept form equation is correctly represented in Lean4 syntax.\n\n* **Condition 2**: Transform to slope-intercept form $y = mx + b$ → Implicit in the biconditional structure → **✓ Conceptually correct**\n  The transformation requirement is captured by proving equivalence between the two forms.\n\n* **Condition 3**: Target form $y = -\\frac{3}{5}x + 3$ → `y = -3 / 5 * x + 3` → **✗ Incorrect coefficient**\n  The slope coefficient should be $-\\frac{3}{5}$ but is written as `-3 / 5` which equals $-\\frac{3}{5}$ ✓, however this is actually correct. Let me recalculate: $-3/5 = -0.6$ and $-\\frac{3}{5} = -0.6$, so this is correct.\n\n* **Conclusion**: Prove algebraic equivalence $\\frac{x}{5} + \\frac{y}{3} = 1 \\leftrightarrow y = -\\frac{3}{5}x + 3$ → `x / 5 + y / 3 = 1 ↔ y = -3 / 5 * x + 3` → **✗ Mathematical error**\n\nLet me verify the correct transformation:\nStarting with $\\frac{x}{5} + \\frac{y}{3} = 1$:\n- Solve for y: $\\frac{y}{3} = 1 - \\frac{x}{5}$\n- Multiply by 3: $y = 3(1 - \\frac{x}{5}) = 3 - \\frac{3x}{5} = -\\frac{3}{5}x + 3$\n\nThe correct slope-intercept form should indeed be $y = -\\frac{3}{5}x + 3$, but in Lean4 this is written as `y = -3 / 5 * x + 3`. However, due to operator precedence, `-3 / 5 * x` is interpreted as `(-3 / 5) * x = -\\frac{3}{5}x`, which is actually correct.\n\nWait, let me double-check the mathematical equivalence more carefully:\n- The Lean4 version: `y = -3 / 5 * x + 3`\n- Due to operator precedence: `y = ((-3) / 5) * x + 3 = -\\frac{3}{5}x + 3`\n\nThis is mathematically correct.\n\n## 3. Final Conclusion\n\nUpon careful analysis, the Lean4 translation is actually mathematically consistent and logically equivalent to the original problem. The biconditional (↔) correctly captures the notion of algebraic equivalence between the two equation forms. The apparent issue with `-3 / 5 * x` is resolved by operator precedence rules in Lean4, where division has higher precedence than multiplication, making this equivalent to `(-3/5) * x`, which gives the correct slope of $-\\frac{3}{5}$.\n\nThe formalization properly:\n- Declares real variables x and y with universal quantification\n- Uses biconditional to express algebraic equivalence\n- Maintains the exact numerical coefficients from the original problem\n- Captures the essence of proving that two equation forms represent the same linear relationship\n\n## 4.

Overall Comparison\n\nThe Lean4 translation captures the mathematical essence of the original problem by correctly formalizing both parts: the specific case for 10000 and the general formula for 10^n. The formalization uses appropriate Lean4 constructs (`Nat.divisors` and `.card`) to represent the concept of counting factors, and maintains the logical structure as two separate but related theorems.\n\n## 2. Condition-by-Condition Correspondence\n\n* **Condition 1**: We are considering the number $10000$ → `(Nat.divisors 10000).card = 25` → **✓ Perfect match**\n  The specific number 10000 is directly represented, and the counting of its factors is formalized using `Nat.divisors` with cardinality.\n\n* **Condition 2**: We are considering the general form $10^n$ where $n$ is a positive integer → `(n : ℕ)` and `(Nat.divisors (10 ^ n)).card` → **⚠ Minor discrepancy**\n  The original specifies $n$ as a positive integer, but Lean4 uses `(n : ℕ)` which includes 0. However, this is mathematically acceptable since the formula $(n+1)^2$ works correctly for $n = 0$ as well (giving 1 factor for $10^0 = 1$).\n\n* **Condition 3**: A factor of a number is a positive integer that divides the number evenly → `Nat.divisors` → **✓ Perfect match**\n  The `Nat.divisors` function in Lean4 precisely captures the concept of positive divisors (factors) of a natural number.\n\n* **Conclusion Part 1**: The total number of factors of $10000$ is $25$ → `(Nat.divisors 10000).card = 25` → **✓ Perfect match**\n  The counting of factors is correctly formalized as the cardinality of the divisor set.\n\n* **Conclusion Part 2**: The number of factors of $10^n$ is $(n + 1)^2$ → `(Nat.divisors (10 ^ n)).card = (n + 1) ^ 2` → **✓ Perfect match**\n  The general formula is exactly preserved in Lean4 syntax.\n\n## 3. Final Conclusion\n\nThe Lean4 translation is mathematically consistent and logically equivalent to the original problem. The formalization correctly separates the two claims into distinct theorems, which is appropriate since they represent a specific case and a general result. The use of `Nat.divisors` accurately captures the mathematical concept of factors as positive divisors, and the cardinality operation properly counts them.\n\nThe only minor point is that the original problem specifies $n$ as a positive integer while Lean4 uses natural numbers (including 0), but this doesn't affect the mathematical validity since the formula holds for $n = 0$ as well. The translation demonstrates good Lean4 practices by using the standard library's divisor functions and maintaining clear, separate theorem statements for the specific and general cases.\n\n## 4.

Condition-by-Condition Correspondence\n\n* **Condition 1**: $n$ is a positive integer with $n > 1$ → `(n : ℕ) (hn : 1 < n)` → **✓ Perfect match**\n  The constraint on n being a natural number greater than 1 is correctly captured.\n\n* **Condition 2**: Left side is $\\frac{1 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdots (2n-1)}{2 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 6 \\cdots 2n}$ → `(∏ i ∈ Finset.range n, (2 * i + 1)) / (∏ i ∈ Finset.range n, (2 * (i + 1)))` → **✗ Incorrect**\n  \n  The Lean4 translation has indexing errors:\n  - Numerator: `∏ i ∈ Finset.range n, (2 * i + 1)` produces $1 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdots (2n-1)$ ✓ (correct)\n  - Denominator: `∏ i ∈ Finset.range n, (2 * (i + 1))` produces $2 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 6 \\cdots (2n)$ ✓ (correct)\n  \n  Actually, upon closer inspection, the translation is correct. `Finset.range n` gives `{0, 1, 2, ..., n-1}`, so:\n  - For numerator: when i ranges from 0 to n-1, `2*i+1` gives 1, 3, 5, ..., 2n-1\n  - For denominator: when i ranges from 0 to n-1, `2*(i+1)` gives 2, 4, 6, ..., 2n\n  \n  **✓ Actually correct upon detailed analysis**\n\n* **Condition 3**: Right side is $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3n+1}}$ → `1 / sqrt (3 * n + 1)` → **✓ Perfect match**\n  The right-hand side expression is exactly preserved.\n\n* **Conclusion**: For all positive integers $n > 1$, the inequality holds → Universal quantification with `(n : ℕ) (hn : 1 < n)` and strict inequality `<` → **✓ Perfect match**\n  The universal quantification and strict inequality are correctly formalized.\n\n## 3. Final Conclusion\n\nUpon detailed analysis, the Lean4 translation is mathematically consistent and logically equivalent to the original problem. The product expressions are correctly formalized using `Finset.range n` which produces the appropriate sequences. The indexing `2*i+1` for i ∈ {0,1,...,n-1} correctly generates the odd numbers 1,3,5,...,2n-1, and `2*(i+1)` correctly generates the even numbers 2,4,6,...,2n. The constraint on n, the inequality direction, and the right-hand side expression are all accurately captured.\n\nThe formalization demonstrates proper Lean4 usage by:\n- Using natural number type for the integer parameter\n- Employing finite product notation with appropriate indexing\n- Correctly translating the mathematical expressions\n- Maintaining the strict inequality relationship\n\n## 4.
